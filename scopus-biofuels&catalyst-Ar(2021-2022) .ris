AB  - In this study, acid-treated golden apple snail shells (Pomacea canaliculata)-derived calcium oxide (CaO_tr) were used as a high-performance catalyst for the transesterification of palm oil and waste cooking oil (WCO) because the golden apple snail shells were found in plenty in Thailand, and they were also the major pest of rice. The obtained final materials were calcined in air at 800 °C for 3 h referred by TGA analysis denoting as CaO_tr catalyst. All of the catalysts were characterized and tested by using several techniques including XRD, EDX, SEM, basic strength by Hammett indicator method, total basic site by TPD-CO2, and BET specific surface area by N2 adsorption. The results indicated that the CaO_tr had a specific surface area of 7.5544 m2/g and it was higher than CaO_un approximately 2 times. The kinetics of the reaction followed pseudo-first-order with the rates constants of reaction (k) equal 1.35☓10-2 min-1 for the reaction which catalyzed by acid-treated golden apple snail shells-derived CaO catalyst (CaO_tr), while un-treated golden apple snail shells-derived CaO catalyst (CaO_un) gave k value of 1.18☓10-2 min-1, respectively. Under the optimal of reaction conditions at catalyst loading of 5 wt. %, methanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1, reaction temperature 65 °C, and 5% v/v relative to the amount of methanol of THF as a co-solvent; more than 97% yield of biodiesel could be achieved in 150 min by using CaO_tr. The final part, biodiesel product obtained from palm oil and WCO catalyzed by CaO_tr catalyst has high quality and meets the specified standards of biofuels for the diesel engines both of the EN-14214 and ASTM-D6751 standard testing method. Thus, the utilization of the acid treatment method for enhancement of the catalytic activity of CaO catalyst from golden apple snail shells and the applied co-solvent method for increase the performance of biodiesel production was a process with a high potential in the biodiesel production for the community scale and industrial scale. © 2022, Paulus Editora.

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) are a promising green power source due to their merits of using renewable bio-fuels, environmentally friendly bio-catalysts and mild operating condition. For the practical point of view, it is necessary to tune the power output of the cell according to the electric device of interest. However, current approaches that are based on pH- or temperature-sensitive materials and enzymes in anode or the alteration of conductivity in the cathode face several challenges. In this article we designed a novel photo-switch based on the photo-oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the cathode catalyzed by C-dots nanozymes. As the first photo-switch adopting a cathode-controlled strategy, it achieved rapid, sensitive, and repeatable regulation of EBFC current and the power density with the designed working mechanism. After systematically optimizing the concentration of C-dots and TMB as well as the current collector area, the current of the EBFC equipped with the photo-switch rose from 2.3 to approximately 9 μA and the power density increased from 2.8 to 35 μW cm−2 after the 20 min of blue light irradiation, which is an improvement over most reported switches. Thus, this photo-switch makes it possible to adjust the power output of the EBFCs according to the specific photo signal and promotes “smart” EBFC applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-heavy oil (BHO) is a renewable fuel, but its efficient use is problematic because its combustion may emit hazardous air pollutants (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds, NOx, and SOx). Herein, catalytic fast pyrolysis over HZSM-5 zeolite was applied to upgrading BHO to drop-in fuel-range hydrocarbons with reduced contents of hazardous species such as PAH compounds and N- and S-containing species (NOx and SOx precursors). The effects of HZSM-5 desilication and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) addition to the feedstock on hydrocarbon production were explored. The apparent activation energy for the thermal decomposition of BHO was up to 37.5% lowered by desilicated HZSM-5 (DeHZSM-5) compared with HZSM-5. Co-pyrolyzing LLDPE with BHO increased the content of drop-in fuel-range hydrocarbons and decreased the content of PAH compounds. The DeHZSM-5 was effective in producing drop-in fuel-range hydrocarbons from a mixture of BHO and LLDPE and suppressing the formation of N- and S-containing species and PAH compounds. The DeHZSM-5 enhanced the hydrocarbon production by up to 58.5% because of its enhanced porosity and high acid site density compared to its parent HZSM-5. This study experimentally validated that BHO can be upgraded to less hazardous fuel via catalytic fast co-pyrolysis with LLDPE over DeHZSM-5. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgal biomass has been proved to be a sustainable source for biofuels including bio-oil, biodiesel, bioethanol, biomethane, etc. One of the collateral benefits of integrating the use of microalgal technologies in the industry is microalgae's ability to capture carbon dioxide during the application and biomass production process and consequently reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Although microalgae are a feasible source of biofuel, industrial microalgae applications face energy and cost challenges. To overcome these challenges, researchers have been interested in applying the bio-refinery approach to extract the important components encapsulated in microalgae. This review discusses the key steps of microalgae-based biorefinery including cultivation and harvesting, cell disruption, biofuel and value-added compound extraction along with the detailed technologies associated with each step of biorefinery. This review found that suitable microalgae species are selected based on their carbohydrate, lipid and protein contents and selecting the suitable species are crucial for high-quality biofuel and value-added products production. Microalgae species contain carbohydrates, proteins and lipids in the range of 8% to 69.7%, 5% to 74% and 7% to 65% respectively which proved their ability to be used as a source of value-added commodities in multiple industries including agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine, culinary, and cosmetics. This review suggests that lipid and value-added products from microalgae can be made more economically viable by integrating upstream and downstream processes. Therefore, a systematically integrated genome sequencing and process-scale engineering approach for improving the extraction of lipids and co-products is critical in the development of future microalgal biorefineries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Owing to the greatest need and continuous requirement of the fossil fuel, the immediate search of alternate resources to the petroleum fuel is essential. This research deals with the production and utilization of waste cooking oil biodiesel and nanoparticles blends in the direct ignition engine. The nanoparticles added blends was then reinforced with hydrogen flow while conducting the tests. The fuel blends used for the tests were D100 (pure diesel), B10 (90% diesel + 10% biofuel), B20 (80% diesel + 20% biofuel), D100T10 (pure diesel with 100 ppm nanoparticles), B10TH (90% diesel + 10% biofuel with 100 ppm nanoparticles + 5 L/min of H2) and B20T10 (80% diesel + 20% biofuel with 100 ppm nanoparticles + 5 L/min of H2). While conducting the tests, the hydrogen flow was given at the constant mass flow rate of 10 L/min. The performance and emission measures were keenly calculated from the tests. All tests were conducted at different speeds from 1800 rpm to 2800 rpm. The performance parameters were improved by these nanoparticles and hydrogen together with the pure diesel and also with the biodiesel blends. For example, the power, torque and brake thermal efficiency were improved while the brake specific fuel consumption was decreased. The main objective of reducing the emission of CO, CO2 and other UHC was satisfied whereas the NO emission was slightly increased. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the quick increase in industrialization and urbanization, a mass of sludge has been produced on the account of increased wastewater treatment facilities. Sewage sludge (SS) management has become one of the most crucial environmental problems because of the existence of various pollutants. However, SS is a carbon-rich material, which has favored novel technologies for biochar production, which can be utilized for dissimilar applications. This review systematically analyzes and summarizes the pretreatment, modification, and especially application of sewage sludge-derived biochar (SSBC), based on published literature. The comparative assessment of pretreatment technology such as pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, combustion, deashing, and co-feeding is presented to appraise their appropriateness for SS resource availability and the production of SSBC. In addition, the authors summarize and analyze the current modification methods and divide them into two categories: physical properties and surface chemical modifications. The applications of SSBC as absorbent, catalyst and catalyst support, electrode materials, gas storage, soil amendment, and sold biofuel are reviewed in detail. Furthermore, the discussion about the existing problems and the direction of future efforts are presented at the end of each section to envisage SS as a promising opportunity for resources rather than a nuisance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mustard waste briquettes are commercially used as a fuel for power production in boilers, whereas the thermal kinetics of the biomass plays a vital role in deciding the process parameters. The pyrolysis process converts biomass to value-added products such as biochar, bio-oil, and hydrocarbon gases based on the heating rates and temperature. To enhance the pyrolytic activity of mustard biomass, magnetically separable and reusable FeNi alloy catalyst is investigated. The thermo-conversion properties are studied under variable heating rates with 2 and 10% FeNi particles prepared through a facile chemical reduction technique. Thermal kinetics is computed using Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FOW) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) methods. The activation energies calculated using FOW and KAS methods increase with FeNi addition in mustard while the calorific value decreases. The FeNi alloy particles with the spike-like morphology provide better metal-biomass binding resulting in higher activation energy and facilitates the easy decomposition of lignin. The 10% FeNi -mustard shows uniform conversion independent of heating rates, suitable for magnetically recoverable catalytic pyrolysis. Response surface methodology analysis predicts optimum conversion for 10% FeNi added mustard and less significance for the heating rates in concurrence with the experiments. Artificial neural network utilized to predict and validate mass loss for mustard biomass exhibits best fit for the three neural hidden layer and one output layered topology. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Depletion of non-renewable feedstock and severe wastewater pollution due to human activities have created negative impact to living organisms. The potential solution is to implement wastewater treatment and bioelectricity production through algae-based microbial fuel cell. The algae biomass produced from microbial fuel cell could be further processed to generate biofuels through their unique compositions. The consumption of nutrients in wastewater through algae cultivation and biomass produced to be utilized for energy supply have showed the potential of algae to solve the issues faced nowadays. This review introduces the background of algae and mitigation of wastewater using algae as well as the bioenergy status in Malaysia. The mechanisms of nutrient assimilation such as nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon, and heavy metals are included, followed by the application of algae in microbial fuel cell's chambers. Lastly, the status of algae for bioenergy production are covered. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A massive quantity of organic waste is generated globally. Despite its detrimental impacts on all environmental media (soil, water, and air), a sustainable valorization platform for organic waste has not been fully developed. In an effort to reduce the technical gap, this study placed great emphasis on a new valorization route employing the conversion of food/agricultural waste to biodiesel (BD). In this study, the yellow mealworm larvae (MW) were grown on piles of wheat bran to convert carbohydrates to fat through its fast metabolism. The ultimate aim was to enhance the economic viability of BD by producing fat from food/agricultural waste. Fat from MW larvae were then converted to BD through the non-catalytic conversion (authors-invented) process. As a reference, conventional acid/base-catalyzed transesterification of fat from MW larvae was also made. The conventional conversion process revealed a BD yield of 48.55 wt%, which was attributed to the high content of moisture and impurities in the MW extract. The non-catalytic conversion process of MW extract showed a BD yield of 87.75 wt% in 1 min at 370 °C, showing an extraordinarily high tolerance against water and impurities. The non-catalytic reaction also allowed the in-situ conversion of fat in MW to BD even at 320 °C without fat extraction. The enhanced reaction kinetics could be due to the catalytic effects of the alkaline earth metals in MW. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental sustainability requirements and rising energy demands, as well as the depletion of conventional energy resources and environmental deterioration as a result of abrupt climate change, have redirected scientists' focus. For sustainable development, look for renewable sources of green and clean energy. Bioenergy is a great alternative because it may be used to meet a variety of energy needs with the right conversion technology. This overview covers all aspects of biofuels (bioethanol, biodiesel, and butanol) and the criteria for their long-term viability. The focus is on the most recent breakthroughs in biofuel production, emphasizing the role of nanotechnology. In addition, a slew of studies is being conducted on developing strategies for process optimization, such as integration methodologies, less energy-intensive distillation processes, and microbe bioengineering talked about. This can assist in making biofuel production in a real-world market more economically and environmentally viable. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This study offers a promising energy conversion platform to valorize food waste into biodiesel. In an effort to realize this grand challenge, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL), fast food waste consumer, were directly converted into biodiesel through non-catalytic transesterification. Black soldier fly (BSF: Hermetia illucens) is a widely distributed insect, which turns nutrients in food waste into its fat body (lipid) through the simple metabolic mechanisms in the larval stage. Thus, lipid in BSFL grown on food waste was obtained by liquid/liquid extraction, and the extract was converted into biodiesel (93.8 wt% yield) at 65 °C for 8 h by base-catalyzed transesterification. However, non-catalytic transesterification of the extract of BSFL showed 94.1 wt% of biodiesel yield after 1 min of reaction at 390 °C in the presence of a porous material (SiO2). This non-catalytic reaction was also employed for direct conversion of dried BSFL into biodiesel without lipid extraction. In the later part of this study, fuel properties of the BSFL derived biodiesel were measured to evaluate its fuel feasibility. Physical and chemical properties of the biodiesel measured in this study met the Korea and EU biodiesel fuel standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Coffee is a globally consumed beverage that produces a substantial amount of valuable organic waste known as spent coffee grounds (SCG). Although SCG is a non-edible biomass, research initiatives focused on valorizing/utilizing its organic content, protecting the environment, and reducing the high oxygen demand required for its natural degradation. The integration with biorefinery in general and with pyrolysis process in specific is considerered the most successful solid waste management strategy of SCG that produce energy and high-value products. This paper aims at providing a quantitative analysis and discussion of research work done over the last 20 years on SCG as a feedstock in the circular bioeconomy (CBE). Management stratigies of SCG have been thoroughly reviewed and pyrolysis process has been explored as a novel technology in CBE. Results revealed that explored articles belong to Chemical, physical., biological and environmental science branches, with Energy & Fuels as the most reporting themes. Published works correlate SCG to renewable energy, biofuel, and bio-oil, with pyrolysis as a potential valorization approach. Literature review showed that only one study focused on the pyrolysis of defatted spent coffee grounds (DSCG). The insightful conclusions of this paper could assist in proposing several paths to more economically valorization of SCG through biorefinery, where extracted oil can be converted to biofuels or value-added goods. It was highlighted the importance of focusing on the coupling of SCG with CBE as solid waste managment strategy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alcohols could be the biggest factor for the improvement of world biofuel economy in the present century due to their excellent properties compared to petroleum products. The primary concerns of sustainable alcohol production for meeting the growing energy demand owing to the selection of viable feedstock and this might enhance the opportunities for developing numerous advanced techniques. In this review, the valorization of alcohol production from several production routes has been exposed by covering the traditional routes to the present state of the art technologies. Even though the fossil fuel conversion could be dominant method for methanol production, many recent innovations like photo electrochemical synthesis and electrolysis methods might play vital role in production of renewable methanol in future. There have been several production routes for production of ethanol and among which the fermentation of lignocellulose biomass would be the ultimate choice for large scale shoot up. The greenhouse gas recovery in the form of alcohols through electrochemistry technique and hydrogenation method are the important methods for commercialization of alcohols in future. It is also observed that algae based renewable bio-alcohols is highly influenced by carbohydrate content and sustainable approaches in algae conversion to bio-alcohols would bring greater demand in future market. There is a lack of innovation in higher alcohols production in single process and this could be bounded by combining dehydrogenation and decarboxylation techniques. Finally, this review enlists the opportunities and challenges of existing alcohols production and recommended the possible routes for making significant enhancement in production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Necessity and exploitation of fossil fuels is unstoppable in meeting humanity's needs despite being a small and scarce resource. The use of different renewable feedstock materials are vital in the satisfaction of large-scale demand for renewable energy sources without creating environmental problems in order to satisfy energy demand. In this context we covered the production of biofuels from a variety of feedstocks using pyrolysis, direct blending, micro-emulsion, trans-esterification (biodiesel production techniques) and hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, methanogenesis (biogas production techniques) and pyrolysis, thermochemical liquefaction (bio-oil production techniques) along with the focus on increasing biofuel production using nanocatalysts and biochar-based catalysts and the techniques for creating those catalysts. Torrefaction, pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, hydrothermal liquefaction, and gasification are the key methods used to make biochar. Slow pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonisation are the best methods to produce high-yield biochar. Biochar's catalytic activity is influenced by pyrolysis temperature, pyrolysis time, transition metals, and biomass to water mass ratio. However, there are some noteworthy challenges associated with biofuel development. The cost of feedstock and the option of convenient technology for efficient fuel production, the availability of commercially viable nanoparticles, a biological understanding of the nanomaterial and protein system, and microorganism compatibility levels involving enzymes and nanomaterials are all discussed repeatedly. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fuel components were prepared in this study using rubber seed oil via photothermal catalysis under energy-saving conditions. Modified TiO2 was employed as the catalyst in the catalytic reactions. X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), hydrogen temperature-programmed desorbtion (H2-TPD), CO pulse chemisorption analysis, and UV–vis spectroscopy were employed to examine the microstructure and chemical properties of the modified catalysts. The loading of the catalysts with different active metals considerably reduced the bandgap, leading to enhancements in the absorption of visible light. Temperature, H2 pressure, and reaction time were optimised for the photothermal catalytic reaction via the single factor test. The Pt/TiO2 catalyst realised the highest conversion and selectivity among the tested samples at 120 °C and a H2 pressure of 0.4 MPa for 12 h. Additionally, photo-decarboxylation was confirmed via probing with oleic acid to be the predominant process in the catalytic reaction. This research provides an energy-saving strategy for the preparation of biofuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

The freshwater was supplied by a combination of ASD/BCM systems to maintain the salinity level. A GSHP system was also employed to control the BCM temperature. Saltwater was introduced to the ASD after cultivation for salinity control of the BCM. Various growth temperature, salinity levels, and CO2 injection were tested for the cultivation of Nannochloropsis oculata to reach maximum biomass production of 3.17 × 106 ± 0.50 × 105 cells/mL on the 8th day. The cellular concentration of microalgae was measured by image processing which can precisely (R2 = 0.88) assess the concentration by imaging the cultured samples. Finally, the efficiency of biofuel-to-biodiesel conversion of the BBR section was studied in terms of time, catalyst concentration, and temperature, which was obtained 80.4%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The detailed investigation of biodiesel premixing is done in this research in order to make an attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emission, particularly NOx. From the literature survey, it is found that the effect of premixing is not concentrated enough and significant effect of it is yet to be analyzed. The impact of the biofuel premixing on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics was analyzed numerically. Numerical modelling was applied to do such analysis. The simulation for the combustion process in the combustion chamber was done to validate the comparison of a number of cases of different fuel. During the simulation process different fuel conditions were considered. A set of tests was carried out to find the premixing quality. Initially, pure diesel as fuel and the mixture of plain diesel and biodiesel were used to perform the tests. Secondly, biodiesel as fuel and its blends were used but the premixing was done. Similarly, another combination of pure diesel and plain premixed biodiesel in the combustion chamber was also analyzed. The different proportions of the fuel conditions are D (pure diesel), B10, B20 and B100 with B20%, B40% and B60% premixing biodiesel. The premixing effect was also identified by using both without premixing and with premixing fuel conditions in the combustion chamber. The reduced smoke emission was achieved by using the premixed fuels in the chamber in the second case. However, the emission of NOx was increased. Similarly, in the case of plain diesel as fuel and plain biodiesel as premixed fuel, the amount of smoke was reduced significantly but there was no high increment in the emission of NOx. Premixing biodiesel with the combination of pure diesel as the primary fuel provided the improved torque and power output whereas the reduced BSFC. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alternative fuels have recently been researched on diesel substitution, with the target of reducing dependence on petroleum-based fuel in addition to reducing environmental pollution. Thanks to its regenerability and ability to absorb emissions, the opted biofuel tends to be advantageous. The present study explored the autoignition behaviour, in particular the ignition delay and process of combustion that strongly influence exhaust emissions. The analysis used biodiesel blends obtained from palm oil, waste cooking oil, algae, jatropha and tyre pyrolysis oil at various blending ratio from 2% to 20%. These blending ratios were achieved independently through a specific blending technique with pure diesel at different volumetric concentrations. The ignition delay was assessed by means of a rapid compression machine (RCM) under variant injection pressure at an elevated ambient temperature of the reaction chamber. This study discovered significant differences in ignition delays and combustion efficiency when different biodiesel blends were operated under higher injection pressures and higher ambient temperatures. The shortest ignition delay of biodiesel blend fuels is achieved at low blending concentrations, implying that lower concentrations of biodiesel encapsulate a lower fuels viscosity, preceded by excellent spray atomization, premixing, and ignitability. In addition to these implications, the shortest ignition delay was undoubtedly influenced by higher injection pressure and higher temperature conditions in which the expansion of the fuel's molecular bound to the C[sbnd]H bonding deteriorates and bonding energy dissociates. Emissions are lower than pure diesel with an increased concentration of blends; waste cooking oil-biodiesel blends experienced positive effects on the CO, HC and nitrogen oxides (NOx) via variant injection pressure; while significant improvements in HC were noticed for most fuels, corresponding to the elevated ambient temperature circumstances. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study demonstrates the co-hydrodeoxygenation of partially upgraded bio-oil (PUB) obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction of pinewood, with rapeseed oil (RO) to produce bio-derived drop-in fuel. Enhanced miscibility of PUB in RO showed the high potential of HTL bio-oil for co-processing with different refinery streams in existing refineries. Co-processing experiments were conducted in a continuous unit under different processing conditions and the obtained results were compared with the hydroprocessed oils produced from the pure RO. Temperature and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) are found to be important parameters to achieve complete deoxygenation and controlling the properties of co-processed bio-oils. Product quality analysis of co-processed bio-oils obtained under optimized conditions showed no oxygen contents and micro carbon residue but high n-paraffins. Furthermore, boiling point distribution of co-processed bio-oils was measured by SimDis, which was found analogous to boiling range of biodiesel. Fuel characteristic properties such as flash point, pour and cloud points of co-processed bio-oils were also measured and found improved compared to the properties of hydroprocessed oil obtained from RO. Therefore, this study demonstrates that HTL bio-oil can be successfully co-processed with renewable feed and petroleum refinery streams in a continuous hydroprocessing unit without any modification to reduce the environmental impacts and overcome the cost, availability and sustainability issues of oleochemical based feedstocks. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Electrocatalytic hydrogenation is a potential means to upgrade bio-oil under mild working conditions. Here we report the formation of a carbonaceous solid (coke) on the surface of the electrode and its impacts during the electrochemical upgrading of bio-oil. The electrolytic experiments were conducted under the condition of 200 mA cm−2, 25 °C, and ambient pressure. As the electrolytic experiments progressed, the aromatic structures in the bio-oil were decreasing, while the radicals were increasing in their types and concentrations. The aromatic structures in the bio-oil were polymerized to form coke with heteroatom-containing radicals. The coke-covered electrode would enhance the oxidation process and inhibit the transformation of the aromatic structures in bio-oil. Moreover, the heteroatom-containing radicals contained in the initial coke would further enhance the coke formation. Last, an initial strategy was reported to remove the coke deposited on the surface of the electrode during the electrochemical upgrading of bio-oil. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic depolymerization of Kraft lignin towards valuable liquid fuels and monomeric phenols has been a significant and extremely attractive target, but it remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a catalytic system consisted of bifunctional molybdenum oxide based supported catalyst for catalytic lignin hydroconversion into alkylated benzenes and phenols. In the meantime, the achieved yield of liquid product was 95% and petroleum ether extracted product was 65% at 300℃ for 12 h over 20%MoOx/ZIF-8@ZIF-67 catalyst. The calorific value was increased from 25.66 MJ/ Kg to 34.31 MJ/Kg. The characterization studies show the incorporation of MoOx species leads to the synergy between redox sites and acid sites. The product analysis and catalytic studies demonstrate its synergism to promote catalytic cleavage of C-O linkages via the coupled hydrodeoxygenation and alkylation reaction. The reasonable catalytic mechanism and redox cycle route of catalyst indicate that the cooperative catalytic system paves the way for high-efficiency waste lignin utilization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Coke formation during the rapid quenching of volatiles produced from fast pyrolysis of cellulose was investigated in a fixed-bed reactor. The coke sample was collected at the reactor outlet. The chemical structure of the coke was characterized with a Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and a Raman spectroscopy. The thermal stability of the coke was determined with a thermogravimetric analyzer. The results showed that the coke yield decreased from 19.70 wt% to 14.10 wt% with the pyrolysis temperature increasing from 400 to 600 °C. A high oxygen content of 41.31–46.04 wt% was observed for the cokes which was quite similar as that of volatiles, illustrating the close relationship between volatile composition and coke formation. The FTIR results showed that the coke contained abundant oxygen-containing functional groups such as alcohol O–H, aldehydes/ketones C[dbnd]O and alcohol/ether C–O, and aliphatic C–H groups. With the combination of the Raman spectroscopy results, the coke structure appeared to be more aliphatic than polyaromatic. Changes in pyrolysis temperature would alter the coke properties by changing the volatile composition. The dominant coking reactions were finally inferred as the condensation/polymerization of anhydrosugars and aldehydes/ketones. © 2021

AB  - In the transportation sector, the share of biofuels such as biodiesel is increasing and it is known that such fuels significantly affect NOx emissions. In addition to NOx emission from diesel engines, which is a significant challenge to vehicle manufacturers in the most recent emissions regulation (Euro 6.2), this study investigates NO2 which is a toxic emission that is currently unregulated but is a focus to be regulated in the next regulation (Euro 7). This manuscript studies how the increasing share of biofuels affects the NO2, NOx, and NO2/NOx ratio during cold-start (in which the after-treatment systems are not well-effective and mostly happens in urban areas). Using a turbocharged cummins diesel engine (with common-rail system) fueled with diesel and biofuel derived from coconut (10 and 20% blending ratio), this study divides the engine warm-up period into 7 stages and investigates official cold- and hot-operation periods in addition to some intermediate stages that are not defined as cold in the regulation and also cannot be considered as hot-operation. Engine coolant, lubricating oil and exhaust temperatures, injection timing, cylinder pressure, and rate of heat release data were used to explain the observed trends. Results showed that cold-operation NOx, NO2, and NO2/NOx ratio were 31–60%, 1.14–2.42 times, and 3–8% higher than the hot-operation, respectively. In most stages, NO2 and the NO2/NOx ratio with diesel had the lowest value and they increased with an increase of biofuel in the blend. An injection strategy change significantly shifted the in-cylinder pressure and heat release diagrams, aligned with the sudden NOx drop during the engine warm-up. The adverse effect of cold-operation on NOx emissions increased with increasing biofuel share. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Over the last few years, valorization of lignocellulosic biomass has been expanded beyond the production of second-generation biofuels to the synthesis of numerous platform chemicals to be used instead of their fossil-based counterparts. One such well-researched example is 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which is preferably produced by the dehydration of fructose. Fructose is obtained by the isomerization of glucose, which in turn is derived by the hydrolysis of cellulose. However, to avoid harsh reaction conditions with high environmental impact, an isomerization step towards fructose is necessary, as fructose can be directly dehydrated to HMF under mild conditions. This work presents an optimized process to produce fructose from beechwood biomass hydrolysate and subsequently convert it to HMF by employing homogeneous catalysis. Results: The optimal saccharification conditions were identified at 10% wt. solids loading and 15 mg enzyme/gsolids, as determined from preliminary trials on pure cellulose (Avicel® PH-101). Furthermore, since high rate glucose isomerization to fructose requires the addition of sodium tetraborate, the optimum borate to glucose molar ratio was determined to 0.28 and was used in all experiments. Among 20 beechwood solid pulps obtained from different organosolv pretreatment conditions tested, the highest fructose production was obtained with acetone (160 °C, 120 min), reaching 56.8 g/100 g pretreated biomass. A scale-up hydrolysis in high solids (25% wt.) was then conducted. The hydrolysate was subjected to isomerization eventually leading to a high-fructose solution (104.5 g/L). Dehydration of fructose to HMF was tested with 5 different catalysts (HCl, H3PO4, formic acid, maleic acid and H-mordenite). Formic acid was found to be the best one displaying 79.9% sugars conversion with an HMF yield and selectivity of 44.6% and 55.8%, respectively. Conclusions: Overall, this work shows the feasibility of coupling bio- and chemo-catalytic processes to produce HMF from lignocellulose in an environmentally friendly manner. Further work for the deployment of biocatalysts for the oxidation of HMF to its derivatives could pave the way for the emergence of an integrated process to effectively produce biobased monomers from lignocellulose. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, the hydrothermal liquefaction of food waste was investigated for generating bio-oils or biocrudes using a simplified high-throughput reactor. Different operating conditions were parametrically tested for obtaining maximum yield of biocrudes at temperatures from 280 to 340 °C and sample-to-water mixture ratios from 1:3 to 1:7, with 30 min residence time. The biocrude yields were found to increase significantly with increasing temperature and mixture ratio. A maximum biocrude yield of approximately 40% w/w dry basis (from a total liquid product yield of over 56% w/w) and energy recovery of over 70% were obtained at 340 °C and a mixture ratio of 1:7. High heating values of the resulting biocrude and solid residue were remarkably better than those of the raw material. Fatty acids, amides, N-containing compounds, and cyclic ketones were identified to be the main components of the biocrudes using advanced GCxGC/TOF-MS. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis of nutrient-stressed Scenedesmus obliquus microalgae over various supported metal M/Fe3O4-HZSM-5 catalysts (M = Zr, W, Co and Mo) was investigated at a temperature of 500 °C and catalyst to biomass ratio of 1:1. The synthesized catalysts were characterized using XRD, TGA and HRSEM/EDS. The influence of temperature (400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C) and catalyst to biomass ratio (0.25:1, 0.5:1 and 1:1) on pyrolysis product yield was also investigated. The results showed that all the supported metal catalysts during pyrolysis promote aromatization and acid ketonization of bio-oils. The total amounts of acids present in pyrolytic bio-oil significantly decreased from 26.68% (non-catalytic) to between 0.58 and 9.68% (catalytic). Also, production of 2-pentanone was observed to increase from ∼10% (non-catalytic) to 27.36–53.90% (catalytic). In terms of energy recovery, Co/Fe3O4-HZSM-5 had about 40% energy recovery, which was the highest while the least performing catalyst was W/Fe3O4-HZSM-5 with 24.18% energy recovery in bio-oil. Overall, Co/Fe3O4-HZSM-5 catalyst showed better activity in enhancing the bio-oil quality and yield; it had the lowest nitrogen content (4.77 wt%) and highest bio-oil yield (17.73 wt %) as well as highest HHV (39.12 MJ/kg) which is almost similar to that of crude petroleum. © 2021

AB  - This study aims to analyze the products of the catalytic pyrolysis of naturally colored cotton residues, type BRS (seeds from Brazil), called BRS-Verde, BRS-Rubi, BRS-Topázio and BRS-Jade. The energy characterization of biomass was evaluated through ultimate and proximate analysis, higher heating value, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin content, thermogravimetric analysis and apparent density. Analytical pyrolysis was performed at 500 °C in an analytical pyrolyzer from CDS Analytical connected to a gas chromatograph coupled to the mass spectrometer (GC/MS). The pyrolysis vapors were reformed at 300 and 500 °C through thermal and catalytic cracking with zeolites (ZSM-5 and HZSM-5). It has been noticed that pyrolysis vapor reforming at 500 °C promoted partial deoxygenation and cracking reactions, while the catalytic reforming showed better results for the product deoxygenation. The catalyst reforming of pyrolysis products, especially using HZSM-5 at 500 °C, promoted the formation of monoaromatics such as benzene, toluene, xylene and styrene, which are important precursors of polymers, solvents and biofuels. The main influence on the yields of these aromatic products is due to the catalytic activity of ZSM-5 favored by increased temperature that promotes cracking reactions due expanded zeolites channels. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - As the production of biofuels increase, there is an urgent need to easily analytically control their production at the plant level as well as to assess the quality of the final products. Especially method capable of determining fatty acid ethyl ester content of 96.5% is crucial for utilization in praxis. In this work, a refractive index method with required sensitivity was developed and validated by means of a standard reference gas chromatography method. Validation with a considerable set of real unique samples obtained at pilot scale was performed for both purposes – process monitoring at high conversions and final product quality control. The results confirmed a favourable degree of accuracy with a relative deviation lower than 3.5% from the reference value given by the gas chromatography. Moreover, application of the method for quality control of fresh and long-term stored samples revealed that the deterioration of final products during storage can be detected. The developed refractive index method is thus suitable for the simple and rapid evaluation of the quality of produced fatty acid ethyl esters and for analytical monitoring of their production process. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Microalgae farming has gained interest because of the heavy processing requirement of non-renewable fuel sources and increased vegetable oil prices that prevent them from being used for biodiesel production. Chlorella varibilis MK039712.1, a freshwater microalga with 24.0 ± 0.6% w/w lipid was isolated from Valparai, Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu, India, that was dried, lysed to extract it for biodiesel production. The present study aims to produce biodiesel from the Chlorella variabilis MK039712.1 algal oil by optimizing the transesterification conditions by varying catalyst concentration, methanol to oil molar ratio, time, temperature using Response Surface Methodology. At 8:1 methanol to algal oil molar ratio, 0.3 wt % of catalyst, 65 °C reaction temperature and 120 min reaction time, a maximum of 96% biodiesel yield was obtained. The variations in chemical structure of the transesterified algal oil was analyzed using Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy, 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. The fuel properties were also determined and found comparable with the ASTM standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of Microalgae biomass for biofuel production by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) has been proposed as an alternative to traditional fossil fuels. When comparing fossil fuels, Microalgae biocrude has a high nitrogen content, which is one of the challenges that affect this technology. This factor causes operational issues because it lowers the carbon fraction in the chemical composition, which reduces the calorific value and, as a result, raises NOx emissions during combustion. In this work, conditions were established for obtaining Microalgae biomass to allow the production of biocrude with low nitrogen content by HTL. The effect of the variation in nitrogen levels on the culture medium, on cell growth and nitrogen content, was evaluated in the final biomass for the Scenedesmus obliquus strain; at a laboratory scale, the best results (around 0.25 g/L NaNO3) were used at a bench scale with 20 L tubular photobioreactors (PBRs). The remaining biomass was processed through HTL then the resulting biocrude was characterized. The results show that as the nitrogen source in the culture medium increases, the percentage of nitrogen in the remaining biomass and the biocrude produced also increases. It was possible to establish a concentration of nitrogen source in the culture medium that promotes the accumulation of lipids, decreases the protein content in the final biomass and consequently, in the biocrude, without affecting production and yield, a critical factor to take into consideration when assessing the viability of the proposed process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pretreatment of microalgal biomass is essential for the maximal recovery of biofuel precursors packed inside the complex microalgal cell wall. In the present work, microwaves were exploited for efficient pretreatment of wet microalgal biomass. A response surface methodology – Box Behnken design (RSM-BBD) was utilized to obtain the optimum conditions for biomass pretreatment, and a mathematical model was devised. Using the designed experimental setup, the optimum conditions were obtained as 5 min of microwave irradiation time, 700 W output power, and 2 gL-1 microalgal biomass concentration. The model was further validated experimentally. The pretreatment results were confirmed qualitatively through microscopic observations and quantitatively in terms of sugar release and lipid extraction. The optimum conditions were found promising to enhance the lipid extraction by 55.32% compared to the untreated condition. Additionally, the present design showed the importance of water as a green solvent for biomass pretreatment under microwave irradiation. Overall, the current attempt facilitates a cost-effective, green methodology for wet microalgal biomass pretreatment in a short duration. © 2021

AB  - Co-pyrolysis of feedstock with varied compositions is a common practice, during which cross-interaction of volatiles from single feedstock requires particular attentions as it may affect the product properties. In this study, co-pyrolysis of swine manure and pinewood sawdust was conducted. The results proved the interaction of volatiles from pyrolysis of swine manure with pinewood sawdust and their significant impact on the evolution of pyrolysis products. The interaction effect favored the formation of bio-oil and biochar but diminished the production of gases, as the cross-interaction transformed the gaseous precursors into heavier organics. Although cross-interaction facilitated the formation of organics with π-conjugated structures, The Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) characterization showed that the chemical species with large carbon number in the sawdust-derived bio-oil were transferred into the carbonaceous substance. The bio-oil from co-pyrolysis was thus lighter, and the interaction effect also inhibited the generation of nitrogenous species. The cross-interaction of volatiles made the biochar oxygen-rich and enhanced the thermal stability. Furthermore, in situ Diffuse Reflection Infrared Fourier Transform Spectra (DRIFTS) results indicated that the interaction of volatiles resulted in the formation of more functionalities like –OH, -C-H and C[dbnd]O on the biochar. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the continuous rise in fuel prices and the depletion of fossil fuel resources, the alternative biofuel which has good stability and is suitable for engine combustion is the focus of scientists' research. In this study, the method of mixing ethanol with palm oil (PO) and palm kernel oil (PKO) was used to improve the shortcomings of PO/PKO, such as high surface tension, high density and viscosity. Five co-solvents with a biological production background are selected: tetrahydrofuran (THF), polyoxymethylene dimethyl ether (PODE) and three butanol isomers to aid solubility. The results show that with the continuous dripping of the co-solvent, the PO/PKO and the ethanol gradually dissolve each other until the emergence of a single-phase liquid. Among the five co-solvents, the order of solubilization is THF > PODE > n-butanol > 2-butanol > iso-butanol. Also, with the increase in temperature, the solubility-assisting ability increases. When the particle size of the ternary blended fuel microemulsion system reaches the maximum value of 59.65 nm, the composition ratio of ethanol in the basic system is 50%. In addition, PKO has a stronger affinity with ethanol than PO; PKO can be completely miscible with ethanol when the experimental temperature is 35 °C. As the proportion of ethanol increases, the surface tension of the ternary system decreases by 36.2% at most. In terms of fuel property adjustment, THF has the best adjustment effect on solubility and viscosity. Butanol has the best adjustment effect on the density of blended fuel. PODE will corrode copper strips due to high oxygen content. In the future, according to the fuel demand in different scenarios, the proportion of each component in the blended fuel can be adjusted to achieve the optimum in practical applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solid catalyst loss is inevitable by using the traditional separation methods of centrifugation or filtration. To this end, the carbonized MIL−100(Fe) is used to support ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) for synthesizing magnetic solid acid on the purpose of biodiesel production. Influence of preparation factors of loading amount, activation temperature, and activation time on catalytic activity are initially evaluated. With that, the prepared catalyst (CIS) is comprehensively investigated to obtain the optimal esterification parameters for biodiesel production. Moreover, characterizations of TG, XRD, BET, SEM, EDS, FTIR, py−FTIR, VSM, XPS, and Hammett indicator are conducted to elucidate the structure−function relationship between physicochemical property and catalytic activity. Results indicated the CIS is a superparamagnetism material with the saturated magnetism of 22 emu/g, which could be easily recovered from mixture with external magnet. Furthermore, the maximum conversion of 95.68% is obtained with mild conditions: molar ratio of methanol/oleic acid of 8:1 and catalyst amount of 8 wt% at 70 °C for 2 h. Negligible impact is detected for CIS with presence of 5 wt% water content, even with 20 wt% water content, the conversion of 85.88% is still achieved. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, combined effect of ozonolysis (Oz) and temperature on rice straw (RS) hydrolysis was studied. At ozone dosage of 0.006 gO3/g RS, 19% disintegration in the RS fiber crystallinity was observed with 17% reduction in the total carbon content. Thermal (55 °C, 4d) treatment followed after Oz showed the generation of total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and reducing sugars of 537.20 ± 17.09 mg/L/d and 1.18 ± 0.06 mg/L/d, respectively. Biomethane assays after pretreatment of RS showed 26% enhancement in the RS hydrolysis rate constant (k = 0.1885 d−1) with methane yield of 374 ± 6 ml CH4/g-VSsubstrate. The potential scale up feasibility was estimated by calculating net energy balance. A net positive gain of 0.5763 kWh/kg RS was obtained using this pretreatment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Future expansion of corn-derived ethanol raises concerns of sustainability and competition with the food industry. Therefore, cellulosic biofuels derived from agricultural waste and dedicated energy crops are necessary. To date, slow and incomplete saccharification as well as high enzyme costs have hindered the economic viability of cellulosic biofuels, and while approaches like simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) and the use of thermotolerant microorganisms can enhance production, further improvements are needed. Cellulosic emulsions have been shown to enhance saccharification by increasing enzyme contact with cellulose fibers. In this study, we use these emulsions to develop an emulsified SSF (eSSF) process for rapid and efficient cellulosic biofuel production and make a direct three-way comparison of ethanol production between S. cerevisiae, O. polymorpha, and K. marxianus in glucose and cellulosic media at different temperatures. Results: In this work, we show that cellulosic emulsions hydrolyze rapidly at temperatures tolerable to yeast, reaching up to 40-fold higher conversion in the first hour compared to microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). To evaluate suitable conditions for the eSSF process, we explored the upper temperature limits for the thermotolerant yeasts Kluyveromyces marxianus and Ogataea polymorpha, as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and observed robust fermentation at up to 46, 50, and 42 °C for each yeast, respectively. We show that the eSSF process reaches high ethanol titers in short processing times, and produces close to theoretical yields at temperatures as low as 30 °C. Finally, we demonstrate the transferability of the eSSF technology to other products by producing the advanced biofuel isobutanol in a light-controlled eSSF using optogenetic regulators, resulting in up to fourfold higher titers relative to MCC SSF. Conclusions: The eSSF process addresses the main challenges of cellulosic biofuel production by increasing saccharification rate at temperatures tolerable to yeast. The rapid hydrolysis of these emulsions at low temperatures permits fermentation using non-thermotolerant yeasts, short processing times, low enzyme loads, and makes it possible to extend the process to chemicals other than ethanol, such as isobutanol. This transferability establishes the eSSF process as a platform for the sustainable production of biofuels and chemicals as a whole. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Pyrene (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), an anthropogenic organic pollutant prevalent in various ecological units, receives more attention for bioremediation and energy transformation using microalgae. In this study, we have used pyrene pollutant (50–500 ppm) to evaluate the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of Chlorella sorokiniana and the impact on metabolites as well as the induction of lipid biosynthesis to produce renewable biodiesel. Pyrene concentration at 230 ppm (IC50) caused half-maximum inhibition for the 96 h incubation. The harvest in the stationary stage (day 16) for C. sorokiniana revealed a biomass generation of 449 ± 7 mg L−1 and 444 ± 8 mg L−1 dcw in the control medium and pyrene IC50 medium, respectively. An insignificant decline in biomass generation (1.2%) was observed due to the stress effect of the pyrene IC50 medium on metabolic biosynthesis. Although contrary to biomass generation, IC50 of pyrene assisted to induce lipid biosynthesis in C. sorokiniana. The improvement in lipid biosynthesis was observed as ~24% higher in pyrene IC50 compared to the control medium. The chemical composition of the microalgae biomass, metabolites, and lipids was examined using FTIR spectra. The extracted lipid was transesterified to produce biodiesel via methanolic-H2SO4 catalysis. The renewable biodiesel obtained was evaluated using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The transformation efficiency of the lipid of C. sorokiniana in biodiesel was calculated as ~81%. This research offers the incentive in lipid biosynthesis in microalgae cells using pyrene for the production of renewable and sustainable ecological biofuels along with bioremediation of pyrene. © 2021

AB  - Background: Production of biodiesel from renewable sources such as inedible vegetable oils by enzymatic catalysis has been a hotspot but remains a challenge on the efficient use of an enzyme. COFs (Covalent Organic Frameworks) with large surface area and porosity can be applied as ideal support to avoid aggregation of lipase and methanol. However, the naturally low density limits its application. In this work, we reported a facile synthesis of core–shell magnetic COF composite (Fe3O4@COF-OMe) to immobilize RML (Rhizomucor miehei lipase), to achieve its utilization in biodiesel production. Result: This strategy gives extrinsic magnetic property, and the magnetic COFs is much heavier and could disperse in water medium well, facilitating the attachment with the enzyme. The resultant biocomposite exhibited an excellent capacity of RML due to its high surface area and fast response to the external magnetic field, as well as good chemical stability. The core–shell magnetic COF-OMe structure not only achieved highly efficient immobilization and recovery processes but also maintained the activity of lipase to a great extent. RML@Fe3O4@COF-OMe performed well in practical applications, while free lipase did not. The biocomposite successfully achieved the production of biodiesel from Jatropha curcas Oil with a yield of about 70% in the optimized conditions. Conclusion: Magnetic COFs (Fe3O4@COF-OMe) for RML immobilization greatly improved catalytic performance in template reaction and biodiesel preparation. The magneticity makes it easily recovered and separated from the system. This first successful attempt of COFs-based immobilized enzyme broadened the prospect of biodiesel production by COFs with some inspiration. © 2021, The Author(s).

Despite genetic modification of major wall polymers has been implemented for reduced recalcitrance in engineered crops, it could most cause a penalty of plant growth and biomass yield. Alternatively, it is increasingly considered to improve minor wall components, but an applicable approach is required for efficient assay of large population of biomass samples. Hence, this study collected total of 100 rice straw samples and characterized all minor wall monosaccharides and biomass enzymatic saccharification by integrating NIRS modeling and QTL profiling. Results: By performing classic chemical analyses and establishing optimal NIRS equations, this study examined four minor wall monosaccharides and major wall polymers (acid-soluble lignin/ASL, acid-insoluble lignin/AIL, three lignin monomers, crystalline cellulose), which led to largely varied hexoses yields achieved from enzymatic hydrolyses after two alkali pretreatments were conducted with large population of rice straws. Correlation analyses indicated that mannose and galactose can play a contrast role for biomass enzymatic saccharification at P < 0.0 l level (n = 100). Meanwhile, we found that the QTLs controlling mannose, galactose, lignin-related traits, and biomass saccharification were co-located. By combining NIRS assay with QTLs maps, this study further interpreted that the mannose-rich hemicellulose may assist AIL disassociation for enhanced biomass enzymatic saccharification, whereas the galactose-rich polysaccharides should be effectively extracted with ASL from the alkali pretreatment for condensed AIL association with cellulose microfibrils. Conclusions: By integrating NIRS assay with QTL profiling for large population of rice straw samples, this study has identified that the mannose content of wall polysaccharides could positively affect biomass enzymatic saccharification, while the galactose had a significantly negative impact. It has also sorted out that two minor monosaccharides could distinctively associate with lignin deposition for wall network construction. Hence, this study demonstrates an applicable approach for fast assessments of minor lignocellulose recalcitrant factors and biomass enzymatic saccharification in rice, providing a potential strategy for bioenergy crop breeding and biomass processing. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Fungi produce enzymes that degrade the complex lignin thereby enabling the efficient utilization of plant lignocellulosic biomass in the production of biofuel and cellulose-based products. In the present study, the agricultural residues such as paddy straw, sugarcane bagasse, and coconut husk were used as substrates for the biodegradation by Aspergillus nomius (MN700028) and Trichoderma harzianum (MN700029) isolated from gut of the termite, Odontotermes obesus and fungus comb in the termite mound, respectively. The influence of varying concentrations of different carbon sources, pH, and temperature on ligninolytic enzyme production was examined under laboratory conditions. The highest activities of manganese peroxidase (0.24 U/mL), lignin peroxidase (10.38 U/mL) and laccase (0.05 U/mL) were observed under studied conditions. Fungal pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for 45 days showed that A. nomius and T. harzianum degraded 84.4% and 81.66% of hemicelluloses, 8.16% and 93.75% of cellulose, and 52.59% and 65% of lignin, respectively. The interaction of pH, temperature, and different carbon sources with fungal biomass and enzyme production was found significant (p ≤ 0.05). SEM analysis indicated alterations in the microstructures of degraded lignocellulosic substrates. A. nomius and T. harzianum were highly efficient in ligninolytic enzymes production and in vitro digestibility of agricultural residues. The study reports the production of laccase by A. nomius isolated from termite gut for the first time. The fungal isolates A. nomius and T. harzianum posses potential for ligninocellulosic waste degradation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive renewable resource to produce biofuel or platform chemicals. Efficient and cost-effective conversion systems of lignocellulosic biomass depend on their appropriate pretreatment processes. Alkali or dilute acid pretreatment of biomass requires a high temperature (> 150 °C) to remove xylan (hemicellulosic sugar) and lignin partially. In this study, peracetic acid was used to pretreat biomass feedstocks, including hardwood and softwood species. It was found that the thermally-assisted dilute acid pretreatment of biomass conducted under the mild temperature of 90 °C up to 5 h resulted in the effective removal of lignin from the biomass with a negligible loss of carbohydrates. This thermally-assisted pretreatment achieved 90% of delignification, and this result was compared with the microwave-assisted pretreatment method. In addition, the crystallinity index (CrI), surface morphology, and chemical structure were significantly changed after the acid pretreatment. The biomass digestibility increased significantly with increased reaction time, by 32% and 23% for hardwood and softwood, respectively. From this study, it is clear that peracetic acid pretreatment is an effective method to enrich glucan content in biomass by delignification. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Lignocellulolytic enzymes are essential for agricultural waste disposal and production of renewable bioenergy. Many commercialized cellulase mixtures have been developed, mostly from saprophytic or endophytic fungal species. The cost of complete cellulose digestion is considerable because a wide range of cellulolytic enzymes is needed. However, most fungi can only produce limited range of highly bioactive cellulolytic enzymes. We aimed to investigate a simple yet specific method for discovering unique enzymes so that fungal species producing a diverse group of cellulolytic enzymes can be identified. Results: The culture medium of an endophytic fungus, Daldinia caldariorum D263, contained a complete set of cellulolytic enzymes capable of effectively digesting cellulose residues into glucose. By taking advantage of the unique product inhibition property of β-glucosidases, we have established an improved zymography method that can easily distinguish β-glucosidase and exoglucanase activity. Our zymography method revealed that D263 can secrete a wide range of highly bioactive cellulases. Analyzing the assembled genome of D263, we found over 100 potential genes for cellulolytic enzymes that are distinct from those of the commercially used fungal species Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus niger. We further identified several of these cellulolytic enzymes by mass spectrometry. Conclusions: The genome of Daldinia caldariorum D263 has been sequenced and annotated taking advantage of a simple yet specific zymography method followed by mass spectrometry analysis, and it appears to encode and secrete a wide range of bioactive cellulolytic enzymes. The genome and cellulolytic enzyme secretion of this unique endophytic fungus should be of value for identifying active cellulolytic enzymes that can facilitate conversion of agricultural wastes to fermentable sugars for the industrial production of biofuels. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Controlled, stable and uniform temperature environment with quick response are crucial needs for many lab-on-chip (LOC) applications requiring thermal management. Laser Induced Graphene (LIG) heater is one such mechanism capable of maintaining a wide range of steady state temperature. LIG heaters are thin, flexible, and inexpensive and can be fabricated easily in different geometric configurations. In this perspective, herein, the electro-thermal performance of the LIG heater has been examined for different laser power values and scanning speeds. The experimented laser ablated patterns exhibited varying electrical conductivity corresponding to different combinations of power and speed of the laser. The conductivity of the pattern can be tailored by tuning the parameters which exhibit, a wide range of temperatures making them suitable for diverse lab-on-chip applications. A maximum temperature of 589 °C was observed for a combination of 15% laser power and 5.5% scanning speed. A LOC platform was realized by integrating the developed LIG heaters with a droplet-based microfluidic device. The performance of this LOC platform was analyzed for effective use of LIG heaters to synthesize Gold nanoparticles (GNP). Finally, the functionality of the synthesized GNPs was validated by utilizing them as catalyst in enzymatic glucose biofuel cell and in electrochemical applications. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Pretreatments are commonly used to facilitate the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass to its component sugars and aromatics. Previously, we showed that iron ions can be used as co-catalysts to reduce the severity of dilute acid pretreatment of biomass. Transgenic iron-accumulating Arabidopsis and rice plants exhibited higher iron content in grains, increased biomass yield, and importantly, enhanced sugar release from the biomass. Results: In this study, we used intracellular ferritin (FerIN) alone and in combination with an improved version of cell wall-bound carbohydrate-binding module fused iron-binding peptide (IBPex) specifically targeting switchgrass, a bioenergy crop species. The FerIN switchgrass improved by 15% in height and 65% in yield, whereas the FerIN/IBPex transgenics showed enhancement up to 30% in height and 115% in yield. The FerIN and FerIN/IBPex switchgrass had 27% and 51% higher in planta iron accumulation than the empty vector (EV) control, respectively, under normal growth conditions. Improved pretreatability was observed in FerIN switchgrass (~ 14% more glucose release than the EV), and the FerIN/IBPex plants showed further enhancement in glucose release up to 24%. Conclusions: We conclude that this iron-accumulating strategy can be transferred from model plants and applied to bioenergy crops, such as switchgrass. The intra- and extra-cellular iron incorporation approach improves biomass pretreatability and digestibility, providing upgraded feedstocks for the production of biofuels and bioproducts. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Diatom microalgae have great industrial potential as next-generation sources of biomaterials and biofuels. Effective scale-up of their production can be pursued by enhancing the efficiency of their photosynthetic process in a way that increases the solar-to-biomass conversion yield. A proof-of-concept demonstration is given of the possibility of enhancing the light absorption of algae and of increasing their efficiency in photosynthesis by in vivo incorporation of an organic dye which acts as an antenna and enhances cells’ growth and biomass production without resorting to genetic modification. A molecular dye (Cy5) is incorporated in Thalassiosira weissflogii diatom cells by simply adding it to the culture medium and thus filling the orange gap that limits their absorption of sunlight. Cy5 enhances diatoms’ photosynthetic oxygen production and cell density by 49% and 40%, respectively. Cy5 incorporation also increases by 12% the algal lipid free fatty acid (FFA) production versus the pristine cell culture, thus representing a suitable way to enhance biofuel generation from algal species. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) from Cy5 to algal chlorophyll. The present approach lays the basis for non-genetic tailoring of diatoms’ spectral response to light harvesting, opening up new ways for their industrial valorization. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The aim of this is study was to test the hypothesis that corn can be partially replaced by crude glycerin (at a level of 50%) without affecting performance, ingestive behavior, ruminal parameters, meat composition, and fatty acids profile on the meat of heifers. Sixty-four intact plus four rumen cannulated Angus × Nellore heifers (359.0 ± 12.15 kg BW) were used. The cannulated animals received the same diets as the intact ones to determine the ruminal N-NH3 concentration, pH, and chewing activity weekly. All heifers were maintained in Brachiaria brizantha pasture and supplemented with a concentrate containing corn, soybean meal, urea, premixed minerals, and glycerin partially replacing corn. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with two treatments (corn ground or glycerin + corn ground). The inclusion of crude glycerin (high fat) decreased nutrients intake and ruminal N-NH3 concentration in the rumen but increased lipid intake. Inclusion of glycerin had no effect (P > 0.05) on ruminal pH, daily gain, performance, time spent eating, rumination, idling, or water intake. The moisture, ash, and protein contents of meat were not affected (P > 0.05) by crude glycerin intake. Crude glycerin increased saturated fatty acids (C14:0, C16:0, and C18:0) and decreased unsaturated fatty acids (C18:2n6c and C20:1) in meat. Despite the reduction in nutrient intake, we recommend crude glycerin to replace corn in concentrate because glycerin did not impair the performance, meat composition, and ruminal pH. Therefore, crude glycerin is a by-product that can partially replace corn in diets efficiently. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The use of biowaste feedstock is often suggested for sustainable production of synthetic fuels through gasification followed by the Fischer-Tropsch process. While the technical performance of this type of bioenergy system has significantly been investigated, comprehensive sustainability analyses are still required. The present study evaluates the life cycle sustainability performance of synthetic diesel and gasoline from Tunisian date palm waste, and compares it with that of conventional fossil fuels. Life cycle inventories are elaborated to subsequently characterise the performance of the synthetic biofuels under a set of 12 environmental, economic and social indicators. Both environmental and economic hotspots were found to be associated with the need for electricity and oxygen. Direct emissions to the air and the investment in the plant's power section were also found to significantly affect the environmental and economic performances, respectively. Potential social impacts were found to be mainly linked to the supply chain of equipment and infrastructure, while electricity arose as the most contributing operational element. Overall, the evaluated synthetic biofuels could be considered competitive with conventional fossil fuels and contribute to the achievement of sustainable development goals only if environmentally- and socially-friendly (renewable) electricity and oxygen sources are implemented and the scale and configuration of the plant are optimised. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lignocellulosic energy crops are promising feedstocks for producing renewable fuels, such as methane, that can replace diminishing fossil fuels. However, there is a major handicap in using lignocellulosic sources to produce biofuels, which is their low biodegradability. In this study, the application and the optimization of a lignocellulose pretreatment process, named alkaline hydrogen peroxide, was investigated for the enhancement of methane production from the energy crop switchgrass. Four independent process variables, solid content (3–7%), reaction temperature (50–100 °C), H2O2 concentration (1–3%), and reaction time (6–24 h), and three response variables, soluble reducing sugar, soluble chemical oxygen demand, and biochemical methane potential were used in process optimization and modeling. The optimization was performed by two different approaches as maximum methane production and cost minimization. The optimum conditions for the highest methane production were found as 6.65 wt% solid content, 50.6 °C reaction temperature, 2.94 wt% H2O2 concentration, and 16.05 h reaction time. The conditions providing the lowest cost were 6.43 wt% solid content, 50 °C reaction temperature, 1.83 wt% H2O2 concentration, and 6.78 h reaction time. For maximum methane production and cost minimization, specific methane yields of 338.52 mL CH4/g VS and 291.34 mL CH4/g VS were predicted with 62.4 % and 39.8 % enhancements compared to untreated switchgrass, respectively. Finally, it was found that the predicted methane production for the maximum methane production represents 77 % of the theoretical methane yield and 82.22 % energy recovery. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Surface coking is the primary deactivation pattern of metal-based catalyst in biofuel reforming, which hinders the commercial utilisation of biomass. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation with reactive force field is performed to investigate the surface instability induced thermal degradation of Ni nanocatalyst and coke deposition induced catalyst deactivation. Coke deposited on catalyst surfaces is a complex mixture of carbonaceous organics. Coke surrogate models containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated aromatics are proposed to reflect the molecular size and O/C ratio based on the molecular structures identified during lignin pyrolysis and soot inception mechanism. Lindemann index is used to characterize the degree of crystallinity of catalyst. It is found that atoms at unsaturated sites of outer shell show high mobility and tend to modify the coordination number distribution. Mechanisms behind the effects of temperature, PAH size and oxygen content on coke adsorption are revealed from three aspects of molecular collision dynamics, thermal dynamics and kinetics. The modification of crystallinity of catalyst outer shell and the occurrence of seeping after coke adsorption would affect the subsequent catalyst regeneration. This study is expected to provide guidance on the design of anti-coking catalyst, evaluation of catalyst regeneration and reactor optimisation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper reports a study of the combustion dynamics of n-butyl acetate (BA) using the configuration of a burning droplet. Two grades of BA were examined: one (SBA) synthesized by a new process described in the paper that uses a metabolically engineered solventogenic Clostridium strain through an extractive fermentation process using n-hexadecane as the extractant; and one commercially available as a high-purity (99.9%) ‘neat’ BA grade produced by conventional Fischer esterification (NBA). The initial droplet diameter was primarily 0.6 mm with some limited experiments carried out for 0.4 mm droplets to show the influence of convection. Experiments were performed in the standard atmosphere and ignition was by spark discharge. The results showed the presence of impurities in the SBA at mass concentrations totaling about 6% which included n-butanol, n-hexadecane, iso-propyl alcohol and ethyl acetate. Droplet burning rates and flame structures were not influenced by these impurities at this concentration level. In the presence of convection created by buoyancy, droplets burned faster with stretched flames and a luminosity revealing the presence of soot by incandescence at the flame tips. Reducing the initial droplet diameter to 0.4 mm eliminated the convective effect and resulted in near spherical flames. The results presented show that the new synthesis process is a sustainable alternative for BA production with burning characteristics identical to NBA in both convective and stagnant gas transport fields. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study deals with the pyrolysis of sewage sludge to produce eco-friendly and sustainable fuels along with value-added biochar products. The experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed cylindrical glass reactor in the temperature range of 250–700 °C and achieved the product yield of 22.4 wt% bio-oil, 18.9 wt % pyrolysis gases, and 58.7 wt% biochar at 500 °C optimum temperature. The chemical composition of bio-oil was investigated by gas chromatograph-mass spectroscopy and fourier transformation infrared techniques. The ASTM standard procedures were used to assess the fuel qualities of bio-oil, and they were found to be satisfactory. Bio-oil has a greater H/C ratio (3.49) and a lower O/C ratio (1.10), indicating that it is suitable for engine use. The gas chromatographic analysis of pyrolysis gases confirmed the presence of 41.16 wt % combustible gases, making it suitable for use in spark-ignition engines. X-ray fluorescence analysis of biochar showed that it had a good amount of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium along with some micro-and macro-nutrient which proves its potential to utilize as organic manure in the agriculture sector. In addition, the data obtained from the TGA analysis during the pyrolysis of sewage sludge was applied to calculate kinetic parameters via the Coats-Redfern method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass potassium impregnation is used to increase thermal degradation by catalytically influencing the wood components’ conversion mechanisms during torrefaction. Chemical composition of the biomass, including potassium content and process temperature and time, appear as (catalytic or not) torrefaction parameters that impact weight loss, which can be considered performance indicators. The literature on torrefaction reports process performance evaluation by defining severity indexes. Evaluating the torrefaction performance by indexes provides valuable and dimensionless data as input in numerical modeling for up-scaling the analysis of production systems and assessing environmental products and processes. Nevertheless, no study presents an assessment of the torrefaction indexes correlating the potassium catalytic effects with the operating parameters (temperature and time) and the feedstock sensitivity, simultaneously. Therefore, this study examines the effect of biomass potassium impregnation on weight loss kinetics, employing different indexes such as the torrefaction severity index (TSI), the torrefaction catalytic effect index (TCEI), the catalytic index (CI) and modified torrefaction severity factor (TSFmod) to quantify the catalysis on torrefaction. Two hardwoods, Amapaí (Brosimum potabile Ducke) and Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus urophylla × E. camaldulensis), were demineralized and impregnated with different K2CO3 concentrations and then torrefied at 275 °C for 80 min. The process results enabled the assessment of the accuracy of the correlation between the indexes and the non-condensable volatile release during catalytic torrefaction. The TCEI provided the identification of two catalytic enhancement regions marked by 15 and 17 min holding time for Amapaí and Eucalyptus. The CI and TSFmod presented R2≥ 0.97 when validated against the TSI, supporting their accuracy as a performance indicator. The correlation between indexes and non-condensable gases presented significance for 88% of the evaluated cases. The results of the TSI, TCEI and CI indexes as performance indicators are conducive to quantifying the catalytic level for torrefaction operation, reactor design, and production of added-value biofuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - SO3H-bearing carbons prepared from sugars or glycerol were used as catalysts for the production of acetins via a transesterification route. Two methods of preparation of functionalized carbon catalysts were compared: a) an energy-efficient, one-pot synthesis including partial carbonization of precursors with H2SO4 coupled with simultaneous in-situ functionalization and b) a two-step method including template synthesis of carbon followed by functionalization of the obtained product with sulfuric acid or diazonium salt. The synthesized carbons were used in an eco-friendly process of glycerol transesterification with ethyl acetate under different reaction conditions. All the prepared samples were found to effectively catalyze the reaction, producing a mixture of mono-, di- and triacetins (MA, DA and TA, respectively); however, the efficient production of the target compounds, namely DA and TA, which are valuable biofuel additives, was found to be strongly dependent on the content of sulfonic groups on the surface of these catalysts. A direct correlation between –SO3H concentration and glycerol conversion, as well as the yield of higher esters was established. Moreover, the applied method of one-pot combined partial carbonization and functionalization with H2SO4 was shown to be a convenient way to obtain carbonaceous solid acid catalysts that can be used as promising alternatives to modified carbons produced by conventional two-step techniques. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Obtaining bio-fuels (including gas and bio-oil) with high energy density remains a huge challenge due to their high oxygen content. Here we report a novel MoSx catalyst in-situ formed in a pilot-scale plant can effectively promote the co-hydrodeoxygenation (co-HDO) reaction of poplar wood sawdust and vacuum gas oil with H2. Because of the sulfur vacancies on MoSx, the co-HDO reaction is facilitated along with a significant accumulation of oxygen (over 50.0 wt.%) into an oil-insoluble polar-liquid, leading to a high combustion heat of ∼47 MJ kg−1 of the bio-fuels. Besides, the presence of MoSx also affords a lowered molecular weight of the deoxidized bio-fuels. Based on the underlying conversion mechanisms, the co-HDO reaction can be enhanced in the presence of MoSx catalyst by promoting oxygen transfer towards the polar-liquid during the co-HDO process. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The hydro-processing of palm oil in a continuous mini fixed-bed reactor to produce bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) was investigated to improve the production biofuel. Rh/HZSM-5 was used as catalyst to facilitate cracking, hydrogenation, and isomerization reactions. The operating parameters included reaction temperature (400–500 °C), pressure (7–34 bar), weight hourly space velocity (10.0–43.7 h−1), and hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio (36.6:1–220.9:1). The optimal conditions were at reaction temperature of 500 °C, pressure of 34 bar, 0.05 g of catalyst, WHSV of 43.7 h−1, and hydrogen-to-oil molar ratio of 36.6:1. The yield and productivity of C8-C18 were 51.13% and 21.2 kgproduct/kgcath, respectively. The catalyst stability was demonstrated for 600 min. Fuel properties including density, viscosity, cloud point, pour point, acid value, and oxidation stability of the product collected at the optimal conditions were measured and compared with the US and European standards as well as the commercially available B-20 and B100-FAME in Thailand. The extremely short residence time (&lt; 1 min) and the significant decrease in the use of hydrogen were observed along with the high-quality fuel when compared to the other processing techniques. © 2021

AB  - Agave bagasse (AB), a byproduct of tequila production, is a waste generated in large quantities and an emerging alternative for biofuels production. Nevertheless, the use of lignocellulosic biomass for this purpose requires a pretreatment that maximizes its degradation and utilization. Although there are several pretreatment types, using ionic liquids (IL) has become attractive due to its ability to dissolve the lignocellulosic biomass under mild conditions of time and temperature. As a drawback are the high cost of IL's and their high viscosity; thus mixing them with water is a way to overcome these hindrances. This work aimed to evaluate the effect of pretreatment with three diluted ILs on the A. tequilana bagasse structure and sugars production, as well as the potential of the enzymatic hydrolysate to produce methane in batch mode. The evaluated ILs were: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [Emim][OAc], choline lysinate [Ch][Lys] and ethanolamine acetate [EOA][OAc]. The results showed that the IL with the best performance was [Ch][Lys], which not only offered the highest yields of sugar production (0.57 ± 0.03 g total sugars / g bagasse) but also, it is possible to use it at 30 % in a mix with water obtaining similar yields as with pure IL. Enzymatic hydrolysis of IL pretreated AB achieved 50.7 kg sugars and 49.3 kg of sugars for 90 %-[Ch][Lys] and 30 %-[Ch][Lys], respectively per 100 kg of untreated biomass. The enzymatic hydrolysate from the 30 %-[Ch][Lys] pretreated AB was able to achieve 0.28 L CH4/g CODfed, demonstrating that both sugar and methane yields are maintained when pure or 30 %-[Ch][Lys] are used for pretreatment, representing a step forward towards process feasibility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sesame residue is a solid waste produced in the process of production of sesame oil, which can be used as feedstock for the production of biofuels and carbon materials via thermochemical process. This study explores the pyrolysis behavior of sesame residue at different pyrolysis temperatures and heating rates, aiming to explore the effects of temperature and heating rates on the distribution and properties of sesame residue products. Sesame residue contains more aliphatic alkanes and N-containing organics than biomass, and thus cracking reactions dominated distribution of products, at especially increased pyrolysis temperature with high heating rates. Majority of the nitrogen-containing organics were cracked into condensable organics at 350 °C and into gases above this temperature. The abundant long-chain aliphatics also made the bio-oil different from that from biomass pyrolysis. The organic components in sesame residual were generally not thermally stable, a significant portion of which was converted into volatile organics or gases, producing the biochar with low carbon yield, low heating value and the low energy yield. Additionally, the change of functionalities of the biochar versus temperature was investigated, providing reference information for tailoring structure of biochar for further use as functional carbon materials. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the pyrolysis of mustard straw (MS) in a thermogravimetric analyser and in a tubular reactor to recognize its bioenergy capability. The model free methods of Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Vyazovkin were employed for kinetic analysis and Coats-Redfern (CR) method for elucidating the reaction mechanism. Response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design technique was employed to optimize the pyrolysis process parameters to gain maximum amount of bio-oil. The highest bio-oil yield (44.69%) was obtained at the heating rate of 25 °C/min and at 500 °C under inert condition (N2 gas flow rate = 100 ml/min). Further, FTIR and GCMS analysis of bio-oil revealed the presence of different functional groups and valuable chemicals, whereas physicochemical characterization revealed its fuel characteristic. The results confirmed the suitability of mustard straw as a feed-stock for obtaining a cleaner fuel and value added products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Production of second-generation biofuels by upgrading of pyrolysis bio-oil from biomass attracted much attention in recent years. Here, we present a study dedicated to the stabilization of pyrolysis bio-oil over NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst in single-stage fixed bed reactor with different temperature profiles (ramp to the 340 °C). Detailed characterisation of the textural properties of the fresh and the spent catalyst and the determination of the changes in physicochemical properties and chemical composition of the liquid and gaseous products have allowed us to discuss the influence of the temperature profile on the catalyst stability during 80 h time on stream of the bio-oil hydrotreatment. We have observed that the lower average temperature in the reactor can yield stabilized bio-oil with physicochemical properties comparable with bio-oil that was hydrogenated at higher temperatures. Moreover, the catalyst long-term stability was higher when using a slower temperature ramp. Thus, the physicochemical properties of the stabilized bio-oil obtained with the lower average temperature in the reactor was maintained uniform with the increasing time on stream, while deterioration of the properties of the hydrotreated liquid products produced under the faster temperature ramp occurred. Additionally, we have shown that no sulfur loss occurred from the NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst during bio-oil hydrotreatment. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The aviation industry is moving towards increasing the use of renewable fuels to reduce its environmental impact and find alternative supply chains for aviation fuel. Analyzing the technical and economic viability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) conversion pathways provides critical understanding and new insight toward long-term sustainability and commercialization of SAF. This study reviews the catalytic hydrothermolysis (CH) pathway for sustainable aviation fuel production and conducted a detailed techno-economic analysis to determine the economic viability of SAF production from four selected feedstocks - carinata oil, soybean oil, yellow grease, and brown grease. Economic analyses were performed for ‘nth plant’ (mature technology) to assess process costs and sensitivity on minimum selling price (MSP) of SAF. Without incentives, the MSP of SAF produced from soybean oil, carinata oil, yellow grease, and brown grease are $1.50/L, $1.32/L, $1.19/L for and $1.00/L respectively. Regardless of feedstock, the MSP is shown to be more sensitive to the yield of SAF and feedstock cost, than to capital and supplementary costs. Based on the analysis, the CH process is a promising technology to convert renewable oils to SAF, however the projected MSP requires incentives to achieve parity with petroleum jet fuel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis of agricultural biomass is a promising technique for producing renewable energy and effectively managing solid waste. In this study, groundnut shell (GNS) was processed at 500 °C in an inert gas atmosphere with a gas flow rate and a heating rate of 10 mL/min and 10 °C/min, respectively, in a custom-designed fluidized bed pyrolytic-reactor. Under optimal operating conditions, the GNS-derived pyrolytic-oil yield was 62.8 wt.%, with the corresponding biochar (19.5 wt.%) and biogas yields (17.7 wt.%). The GC-MS analysis of the GNS-based bio-oil confirmed the presence of (trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-amine (18.814%), 2-Fluoroformyl-3,3,4,4-tetrafluoro-1,2-oxazetidine (16.23%), 5,7-dimethyl-1H-Indazole (11.613%), N-methyl-N-nitropropan-2-amine (6.5%) and butyl piperidino sulfone (5.668%) as major components, which are used as building blocks in the biofuel, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Furthermore, a 2 × 5 × 1 artificial neural network (ANN) architecture was developed to predict the decomposition behavior of GNS at heating rates of 5, 10, and 20 °C/min, while the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were estimated using a non-isothermal model-free method. The Popescu method predicted activation energy (Ea) of GNS biomass ranging from 111 kJ/mol to 260 kJ/mol, with changes in enthalpy (ΔH), Gibbs-free energy (ΔG), and entropy (ΔS) ranging from 106 to 254 kJ/mol, 162–241 kJ/mol, and −0.0937 to 0.0598 kJ/mol/K, respectively. The extraction of high-quality precursors from GNS pyrolysis was demonstrated in this study, as well as the usefulness of the ANN technique for thermogravimetric analysis of biomass. © Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wastewater sludge from a poultry slaughterhouse treatment plant was recovered through conversion into biodiesel by ultrasound-assisted in situ transesterification. The main effects of the process parameters were investigated at three levels, and their empirical relationship was modeled using artificial neural network (ANN) and response surface methodology (RSM). The developed models predicted the process behavior with excellent accuracy. Although both models had similar prediction performances, ANN marginally outperformed RSM. The capability of the genetic algorithm (GA) combined with the RSM (RSM-GA) and ANN (ANN-GA) models was evaluated for optimizing the process variables. The maximum biodiesel yield (21.45% w/w) was obtained using the ANN-GA model under optimized conditions, i.e., at the reaction time of 39.69 min, H2SO4 concentration of 3.34% (v/v), methanol-to-sludge relative content of 14.91:1 (mL/g), and ultrasound power of 104.87 W. Consequently, a combination of ANN and GA was proposed to model and optimize the transesterification process. The biodiesel yield obtained in this study was higher than the previously reported values from tannery (10.98%), dairy (13.46%), and municipal (18.58%) sewage sludge. This study specified biodiesel with a fatty acid methyl esters content of 96.86% using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mixture Temperature-Controlled combustion is a novel concept featuring ultra-low pollutant emission. Since the resulting distributed combustion is highly homogeneous, NOX emission can be kept below 10 ppm. The available renewable fuels worldwide vary a lot in their characteristics. Three renewable hydrocarbon fuels: coconut oil, palm oil, and waste cooking oil-rapeseed oil methyl esters were tested along with three conventional fuels: standard jet fuel (JP-8), standard diesel oil, and natural gas. The ultimate goal of the present study was the comparison of the flame structures, chemiluminescent, and pollutant emissions of various fuels, exploiting distributed combustion offered by the novel burner concept. As mixture preparation is highly sensitive to fuel vaporization, distillation curves of the five investigated liquid fuels were measured and evaluated. Density, surface tension, and viscosity were also measured to compare the estimated atomization characteristics. The tests were uniformly performed at 13.3 kW thermal power and an equivalence ratio of 0.8, varying atomizing pressure and air preheating temperature. It was found that jet fuel, diesel fuel, and coconut biodiesel bear the highest potential for distributed combustion in gas turbines, while incorrect burner setup may lead to unacceptably high emissions. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Synthesis of hybrid nanomaterials in the lab-scale frequently involves complex processing and often is not able to be adopted in the industry without major enhancements for its commercial production. This research is focused on a convenient route for the fabrication of chitosan-supported magnetically recoverable carbon bio-nanocomposites by functionalizing magnetic nanoparticles on chitosan and renewable carbon material using solvothermal carbonization co-precipitation (STCC). This process can be adopted in large-scale synthesis with minimum enhancements. The nanocomposites produced using STCC offered excellent features including porous and ultrafine nanostructure, stable mechanical, and chemical properties. From the analysis of variance (ANOVA), the temperature has been found to be the most influential factor for both magnetic nanocomposite and bio-oil yield. The highest porosity for nanocomposites was observed with water-based synthesis at 260 °C at 194.62 m2/g. However, water/ethanol (50:50) at 260 °C yielded 6.67% and 8.01% more bio-oil and having 5.35% and 3.49% higher heating value as compared to that of bio-oil produced using water and ethanol. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the economic feasibility of jojoba cultivation for biodiesel production in Jordan is analyzed. The investigations are carried out for all activities and operations from jojoba farming, through oil extraction to biodiesel production and byproduct utilization. A thousand-hectare farm, in the eastern Badia of Jordan planted with 1666 jojoba trees per hectare, is selected as a case study area. Over the 20 years life of the project, an average annual seed production of 2.5 kg per tree, with oil content of 50%, is assumed. The amount of biodiesel produced is predicted at 1750.62 tons/year. The total fixed cost and annual operating cost are estimated at US$ thousand 12701.36 and US$ thousand 2352.38, respectively. The largest contributor to these values is the cost of the drip irrigation system, which forms about 45.83% of the total fixed capital cost and 25.79% of the total direct operating cost. The farm establishment cost contributes to 22.17% of the fixed cost, while the main biodiesel production plant represents only 6.0%. The biodiesel production cost is predicted at US$ 1.19/L when the glycerol is sold as a byproduct. However, when glycerol is converted into solketal, the credit of solketal reduces the biodiesel production cost to US$ 0.70/L. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The article presents the studies on the biomass yield, heating value and thermal decomposition process of the shoots of Lavatera thuringiaca L. plants (solid biofuel) of different age (one to three years old) grown from He–Ne laser stimulated seeds. Five combinations of Lavatera biomass characterized by different pre-sowing seed exposure times to laser light (1–30 min) were investigated. The results showed that the exposure time of, respectively, 10, 15 and 30 min had the most pronounced effect on the increase of biomass yield for two-year old shoots and the heating values for one-, two- and three-year old shoots biomass in relation to the control. Over the three experimental years, significant differences in the H, N, fixed carbon and ash content between the combinations of shoots were found. For the tested biomass after the exposition to laser light as well as for older plants, the ignition and burnout temperatures were shifted towards higher values. Stimulation with laser light affected the maximum mass loss rate as well as corresponding temperature for the investigated shoots. The two-year old combinations were characterized by better combustion index in comparison to one- and three-year old ones. As mentioned above, laser light stimulation of Lavatera seeds can contribute to the heating value and biomass yield increase and, as a result, to a more effective fossil fuel replacement. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic processes play an important role in the valorization of biomass for the production of biofuels. In this context, the effect of desilication of MOR zeolite (H-MOR-D) on the esterification of oleic acid as a model reaction for biomass conversion was investigated. Zeolite catalysts were characterized by BET, TG, NH3-TPD, XRD, XRF, FTIR and 27Al MAS NMR analysis and the results showed that the alkaline treatment caused a decrease in crystallinity and removal of sites with greater acid strength of the zeolite precursor. The conversion of oleic acid into methyl oleate catalyzed by H-MOR was less (44%) than that obtained by the treated zeolite H-MOR-D (70%), suggesting that the catalytic activity in the MOR structure does not depend only on the high density of strong acid sites. DFT calculations showed that, bulky molecules suffer molecular distortions within the confined voids, consequently the adsorption enthalpy is highly unstable limiting the formation of intermediates and thus contributing to the lower reaction rate observed experimentally in H-MOR zeolite. Desilication should be considered in projects for the synthesis of new catalysts type zeolite for the conversion of biomass crude or pre-treated, in which bulky molecules prevail. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of biomass results in the formation of bio-oil, aqueous phase (HTL-AP), bio-char, and gaseous products. Safer disposal of HTL-AP is difficult on an industrial scale since it comprises low molecular acid compounds. This review provides a comprehensive note on the recent articles published on the effective usage of HTL-AP for the recovery of valuable compounds. Thermo-chemical and biological processes are the preferred techniques for the recovery of biofuel, platform chemicals from HTL-AP. From this review, it was evident that the composition of HTL-AP and product recovery are the integrated pathways, which depend on each other. Substitute as reaction medium in HTL process, growth medium for algae and microbes are the most common mode of reuse and recycle of HTL-AP. Future research is needed to depict the mechanism of HTL process when HTL-AP is used as a reaction medium on an industrial scale. Need to find a solution for the hindrance in commercializing HTL process and recovery of value-added compounds from HTL-AP from lab scale to industry level. Integrated pathways on reuse and HTL-AP recycle helps in reduced environmental concerns and sustainable production of bio-products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work is a significant contribution to the production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) from carbohydrates-based feedstocks using environmentally benign choline chloride (ChCl)-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as catalyst in the presence of an inexpensive acetone/water solvent system. Under microwave irradiations, the acidity of organic acids in DESs can be a key criterion in screening out different eutectic mixtures. Among others, the ChCl: Lactic acid (LA) mixture was found to be the most efficient DES giving a 5-HMF yield of 30.12% on fructose dehydration. Optimization of different reaction parameters resulted in an enhanced 5-HMF yield of 87.2% in 30 min at 140 °C using ChCl: LA DES. The synergistic effect between LA and ChCl is also highlighted in boosting the 5-HMF yield. As compared to conventional oil bath heating, microwave heating resulted in significantly higher 5-HMF yield at a lower reaction time. The catalytic system ChCl: LA showed an appreciable yield of 5-HMF ranging from 83.1 to 71.2% for 5 recycle runs. Overall, we have developed a low cost, easy, energy-effective, green, and sustainable process ensuring high 5-HMF production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Coal to liquid (CTL) is a diesel alternative fuel based on Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, which has shown promising application value. Besides, as an oxygenated biofuel with high oxygen content and volatility, n-butanol can be blended with hydrocarbon fuels to improve engine performance. This study aims to investigate the effects of CTL/n-butanol blends on the performance of the compression-ignition (CI) engine, and to reveal the influence of combustion boundary conditions such as n-butanol blending ratio, the start of injection (SOI), and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on the combustion and emissions characteristics. The results show that blending n-butanol with CTL is beneficial to improve the fuel-gas mixture distribution in the cylinder, and the premixed combustion ratio (PCR) increases by 13.66% as the energy ratio of n-butanol increases to 30% (B30) compared with the pure CTL. CTL/n-butanol blends make particulate emission tend to be shifted towards nucleation mode and the particulate mass emission significantly reduced, especially the particulate mass of B30 reduce by 68.6%; meanwhile, the NOx emission shows an upward trend. Compared with n-butanol blended, adjusting the SOI impacts NOx emissions significantly, while its influence on the indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) and particulate emissions is relatively slight. Moreover, through the synergistic control of n-butanol addition and EGR, the trade-off relationship between NOx and particles is mitigated. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein, a suitable pretreatment based on an acidic ionic liquid was employed for superior enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw, which is regarded as an inexpensive, easily accessible, and renewable agricultural waste. Using 1-(carboxymethyl)pyridinium chloride as an acidic ionic liquid, containing, both acetate and chloride groups, a superior penetration between cellulose chains and a proper dissolution can be easily achieved. Different analyzes, including FT-IR, XRD, and SEM, were conducted, indicating restructuring and increased free volume between cellulose chains in rice straw. Following the proper pretreatment with the ionic liquid, the next step in the fermentation and enzymatic hydrolysis process was well conducted, and promising results were attained for biofuel productions. The effects of water as a co-solvent, pretreatment time (2, 3, 5 h), temperature (25, 90, 120 °C), and solid loading (5, 6, 15% w/w) were investigated for maximum ethanol production. The best results were obtained in 35% water, at room temperature, and 6% (w/w) solid loading for 3 h. The hydrolysis yield in ethanol production was improved to 62.2% of the theoretical maximum. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to the large size of free fatty acid molecules, they cannot diffuse into Al–Si–P Zeotype pores in the biofuel production process. Therefore, in the current work, to rectify this problem, in the synthesis of Al–Si–P zeotype by hydrothermal method, various weight percentages of the carbon casting and ultrasound waves for the uniform of the materials were used. Moreover, to enhancement the acidic strength and catalyst performance, Ceric oxide was accommodated on the Al–Si–P zeotype structure by sono-solvothermal synthesis. TPD-NH3, FESEM, HRTEM, BET-BJH, and EDX analyses were utilized for characterizing the samples developed in the present work. BET analysis has revealed that the optimized percentage of charcoal active is 4 wt %. By adding the sonication technique at the stage accommodating Ceric oxide on Al–Si–P zeotype, the conversion percentage increased from 77 to 94%. Test of the capability of modified Al–Si–P Zeotype with sonication and carbon casting to produce biofuel from waste oil delivered a conversion of 91.5%. Kinetic studies have shown that reaction of oil to biofuel is of the first degree, and the modified Al–Si–P Zeotype with sonication and carbon casting has the highest rate constant (0.0014 min−1) among all of the synthesized samples. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ordered mesoporous MgAl2O4 support was synthesized by one-pot evaporation-induced self-assembly method with block copolymers. Nanocomposite catalysts were prepared by loading this support with PrNi0.9Ru0.1O3 perovskite or Ni + Ru-doped Ce0.35Zr0.35Pr0.3O2 fluorite oxides. Their texture, structure, surface properties and reactivity have been studied by combination of modern structural, spectroscopic and kinetic methods. Suppression of MgAl2O4 support acidity, strong interaction of small Ru-Ni alloy nanoparticles with the surface layers of this support modified by perovskite and fluorite oxides with a high oxygen mobility and reactivity provide a high activity and stability to coking and sintering of these catalysts in all studied reactions of methane and ethanol transformation into syngas. Ni + Ru/Ce0.35Zr0.35Pr0.3O2/MgAl2O4 active component loaded on honeycomb Fechraloy foil substrate demonstrated a high performance and stability to coking in autothermal natural gas oxi-dry reforming, ethanol steam reforming and autothermal reforming of ethyl acetate in concentrated feeds promising for the practical application. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study investigates synthesis of liquid fuels and higher hydrocarbons via Fischer Tropsch (FT) reaction using combustion synthesis (CS) catalysts. The CS method employed citric acid (C6H8O7) as fuel with lean stoichiometry (ϕ = 0.3, ϕ = 0.6) for the catalyst synthesis. CS reactions at lean conditions can be easily controlled, and holds the structural integrity of the catalyst support, resulting in no loss of active sites. The fuel-lean conditions show decreased formation of cobalt aluminates, resulting in high catalyst reducibility and larger fraction of active sites. When tested at constant space velocity, the CS catalysts achieve CO conversion up to 88%, which is 57% higher than the wet impregnation (WI) synthesized catalysts. Furthermore, the variation of the equivalence ratio allows to tailor the catalyst properties and thereby control conversion and selectivity of the CS catalysts. CS(ϕ = 0.6) showed a C5+ selectivity 31% higher compared to the CS(ϕ = 0.3). The liquid fuel space time yield (STY) ranged from 0.13 to 0.30 (gC5+ gcat-1 h-1) and it increases in the following order: WI &lt; CS(ϕ = 0.3) &lt; CS(ϕ = 0.6). These results emphasize the effectiveness of the CS method for the synthesis of FT catalysts and show the effect of the lean-fuel stoichiometry on the catalyst properties and performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study reports mild temperature hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of vanillin an oxygenated phenolic compound found in bio-oil to creosol. It investigates the sensitivity of vanillin HDO reaction to changes in solvent, catalyst support and active metal type, and processing parameters using 100 ml batch reactor. The processing parameters considered include temperature (318 K – 338 K), hydrogen gas pressure (1 MPa – 3 MPa), catalyst loading (0.1 kg/m3 – 0.5 kg/m3), and agitation speed (500 rpm–900 rpm). As expected, significant variation in conversion and product selectivity was displayed in the results. Among the solvents considered, 2-propanol and ethyl acetate produced the best performance with conversion close to 100 % and selectivity toward creosol above 90 %. Remarkable differences were found in the H2 uptake during VL HDO reaction under different catalyst. The hierarchy in H2 uptake of the catalysts include: Pd/C &gt; PdRh/Al2O3 &gt; Pd/Al2O3 = Pt/C &gt; Pt/SiO2 &gt;&gt; Rh/Al2O3. This was correlated to catalytic performance; Pd/C emerged as the best among the monometallic catalysts with 71 % selectivity toward creosol, but consumed 9 mmol of hydrogen per mol of vanillin converted. While the prepared bimetallic PdRh/Al2O3 catalyst consumed slightly lower amount of hydrogen (8 mmol), and produced significantly higher selectivity toward creosol (99 %). Even after three cycles the prepared catalyst demonstrated superior performance over the monometallic catalysts with selectivity toward creosol above 80 %. The reaction condition that maximises the degree of deoxygenation to creosol derived via Taguchi analysis includes temperature 338 K, hydrogen gas partial pressure 3.0 MPa, catalyst loading 0.5 kg/m3, and agitation speed 500 rpm. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work aimed the application of a new biocatalyst for biodiesel production from residual agro-industrial fatty acids. A recombinant Pichia pastoris displaying lipase from Rhizomucor miehei (RML) on the cell surface, using the PIR-1 anchor system, were prepared using glycerol as the carbon source. The biocatalyst, named RML-PIR1 showed optimum temperature of 45 °C (74.0 U/L). The stability tests resulted in t1/2 of 3.49 and 2.15 h at 40 and 45 °C, respectively. RML-PIR1 was applied in esterification reactions using industrial co-products as substrates, palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) and soybean fatty acid distillate (SFAD). The highest productivity was observed for SFAD after 48 h presenting 79.1% of conversion using only 10% of biocatalyst and free-solvent system. This is about ca. eight times higher than commercial free RML in the same conditions. The stabilizing agents study revealed that the treatment using glutaraldehyde (GA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) enabled increased stability and reuse of biocatalyst. It was observed by SEM analysis that the treatment modified the cell morphology. RML-PIR1-GA presented 87.9% of the initial activity after 6 reuses, whilst the activity of unmodified RML-PIR decreased by 40% after the first use. These results were superior to those obtained in the literature, making this new biocatalyst promising for biotechnological applications, such as the production of biofuels on a large scale. © 2021

AB  - Sustainable power generation for portable electronic devices is of high interest due to increasing energy demands. Miniaturized biofuel cells are well-reported for this purpose where ubiquitous fluids, like glucose or lactate, can be leveraged. However, such biofuel cells need enzymes to complete the catalysis, leading to many prevalent issues like the longevity of enzymes, complicated immobilization, additional mediators etc. Therefore, non-enzymatic glucose biofuel cells (NEGBFCs) are gaining interest due to their cost-effectiveness, high repeatability and excellent stability. However, based on our best knowledge such glucose biofuel cells are not reported in microfluidic environment, and therefore their potential is not exploited. Realization of the functionality of such NEGBFCs in a microscale is crucial to replace them with their enzymatic counterparts. In this work, for the first time, a microfluidic non-enzymatic glucose biofuel cell (μNEGBFC) is developed on a paper-based platform using metallic catalysts. The catalysts for electrocatalytic energy generation is fabricated using electrodeposition method and their detailed physicochemical characterizations are done. The μNEGBFC is capable of producing a power density of 12.5 μW/cm2 with a stable potential of 410 mV. This green power output can be used to operate low-power micro-devices and lab-on-chip sensors in a more continual and viable manner. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Biodiesel is promoted as a sustainable replacement for commercial diesel. Biodiesel fuel and exhaust properties change depending on the base feedstock oil/fat used during creation. The aims of this study were, for the first time, to compare the exhaust exposure health impacts of a wide range of biodiesels made from different feedstocks and relate these effects with the corresponding exhaust characteristics. Method: Primary airway epithelial cells were exposed to diluted exhaust from an engine running on conventional diesel and biodiesel made from Soy, Canola, Waste Cooking Oil, Tallow, Palm and Cottonseed. Exhaust properties and cellular viability and mediator release were analysed post exposure. Results: The exhaust physico-chemistry of Tallow biodiesel was the most different to diesel as well as the most toxic, with exposure resulting in significantly decreased cellular viability (95.8 ± 6.5%) and increased release of several immune mediators including IL-6 (+223.11 ± 368.83 pg/mL) and IL-8 (+1516.17 ± 2908.79 pg/mL) above Air controls. In contrast Canola biodiesel was the least toxic with exposure only increasing TNF-α (4.91 ± 8.61). Conclusion: This study, which investigated the toxic effects for the largest range of biodiesels, shows that exposure to different exhausts results in a spectrum of toxic effects in vitro when combusted under identical conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Montmorillonite clay was chemically modified by grafting of 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxy silane on the clay surface, followed by sulfonation of the terminal thiol groups. The chemical structures and surface characteristics of the prepared catalysts were characterized by FTIR, XRD, TPD, and BET analysis. The catalytic pyrolysis of Jatropha curcas oil and waste cooking oil for the production of biofuels was stimulated using the prepared catalyst. The conversion of oils into biofuels was performed at 350 °C using different catalysts amounts (0.2–1%). The obtained biofuels were characterized using density, flash, pour, and cloud points, water, sulfur, and ash contents, in addition to kinematic viscosity, copper strip, and carbon residue. Furthermore, the obtained biofuels were fractionated at 250 °C to obtain the light hydrocarbon components, which were evaluated as biojet fuel. The physical and fuel properties of biodiesel-petroleum diesel blends (B10), and biojet-JET A-1 blends were following the ASTM and IP specifications. The most suitable catalyst ratio during the catalytic cracking process was monitored at 0.8%. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a bio-based process for the catalytic conversion of cellulose to ethyl levulinate and an analysis of its techno-economic feasibility. The said bio-based process relies as major feedstock on cellulose, which can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass. cellulose is converted to ethyl levulinate via a homogeneous catalytic reaction whereby dilute sulfuric acid in combination with Al salts is the catalyst and ethanol is the solvent and reactant. This approach affords high ethyl levulinate yields but requires complex procedures for used catalyst and solvent recycling. Based on experimental results on the homogeneous catalytic reaction and vapor–liquid equilibrium separation in the previous studies, a simulation was conducted that included process design, energy integration, and economic analysis. Results from this simulation indicated the proposed bio-based process to afford a minimum selling price of US$ 2,830 per ton of ethyl levulinate, which was highly dependent on an off-site supply of heating energy required for ethanol purification. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bioethanol (bio-EtOH) is commonly used as a renewable biofuel additive for gasoline. A novel technology producing bio-EtOH from anaerobic digestion of organic waste (OW) has recently attracted attention. This work presents a deterministic mixed integer linear programming model for the optimal location of OW-based bio-EtOH biorefineries. The proposed model considers OW treatment location, bio-EtOH biorefineries, and truck transport links as a supply chain network (SCN) approach. The objective function of the developed model is to minimize the total bio-EtOH levelized cost (ELC) while satisfying the model constraints consisting of equalities (e.g., mass and energy balances for the bio-EtOH biorefinery) and inequalities (e.g., capacity of the bio-EtOH refinery, truck transport) to meet the regional demands of bio-EtOH. To validate the optimization model, a case study based on a real scenario for South Korea in 2030 was conducted for different bio-EtOH blending rates (E10, E20, E85, E100). The case study results indicate that ELC of E10 containing 10% bio-EtOH from OW products combined with gasoline is USD 3.65/gallon. As the blending rate of bio-EtOH increases, ELC increases to USD 4.36/gallon for E20, USD 8.99/gallon for E85, and USD 10.05/gallon for E100. The optimization results can help determine SCN strategies for an OW-based biofuel economy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study performed a holistic assessment of a novel cracking alternative (olefin metathesis or OMT) that converts plant oil to aviation biofuel using lipids from Camelina sativa L. (camelina). A high-resolution spatially explicit life cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis (HR + LCA + TEA) was employed to elucidate camelina's sustainability case. The potential camelina land was determined via the wheat-fallow Integrated Rotational Cycle (IRC) at county level for the 48 lower states in the U.S. Results revealed these lands were aggregated on the top wheat producing states of Montana, Kansas, and North Dakota at 19.5 × 106 ha, 18.2 × 106 ha, and 19.2 × 106 ha, for 2009, 2012, and 2015, respectively. If the high producing wheat lands (counties with &gt;60,000–80,000 ha) in those states were grown with camelina at U.S. average yield of 1.2 Mg/ha, around 6.35 million m3 (1.68 billion gal) of advanced biofuel will be produced, equivalent to 11.18 % of the expanded Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) volume mandate for advanced biofuel (15 billion gal). LCA results using 1 MJ functional unit and “well-to-air” (WTA) system boundary showed that the operations cumulative energy demand (CED) for the OMT case producing simultaneous biojet, avgas, and diesel was 0.75 MJ/MJ, lower than for hydroprocessed renewable jet (HRJ) fuel (0.77 MJ/MJ) but 6.8 times higher than for petroleum jet (PTJ) fuel (0.11 MJ/MJ). The entire OMT energy demand was offset by the bioelectricity produced (0.57 MJ/MJ) from burning the meal. OMT's net GHG reduction relative to PTJ was 23.34 % but increasing camelina yield from 1.2 to 1.8 Mg/ha increased reduction to 75.71 %. TEA results adapting 100,000 m3/yr biofuel throughput showed that OMT and HRJ had profits of $21.94 M and $24.13 M, respectively, using mass product allocation. The limiting metric for OMT and HRJ was net present value (NPV), and the minimum camelina yield to ensure profit was 1.18 Mg/ha. OMT can achieve maximum profit by selling biojet fuel at a price not lower than $2.75/gal and selling camelina meal feed pellets at a minimum price of $330/Mg. No tax incentive was needed for biojet and avgas because even at their base median values (biojet = $2.19/gal, avgas = $2.59/gal), NPV is still positive. © 2021

AB  - The co-combustion characteristics and kinetics of Fenton/CaO conditioned MSS, and biomass rice husk (RH) are studied by thermogravimetry, and the condition optimization was carried out by response surface methodology (RSM). The results show that the mixed fuel with RH is helpful to decrease Ti and Tb values and increase combustion characteristic index (CCI). The CCI of MSS after conditioning is 0.59–0.88 times lower than that of the pure MSS. In addition, the total Em of S2, MSS/RH mixed combustion after Fenton/CaO conditioning is lower, the combustion reactivity is stronger. According to RSM, the optimum conditions are considered to be: RH mixing ratio 56%, Fenton/CaO conditioner dosage 147 mg g−1 dry solids, heating rate 30 K min−1, the maximum CCI 25.3305 × 10−7%2 °C−3 min−2, and the minimum Em 10.6403 kJ min−1. This study supplies new insights into combustion technology of sludge. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapid industrialization and population growth have resulted in the wastage of significant quantity of food globally throughout the value chain right from harvesting to storage, processing and consumption. Normally, these waste materials are allowed to decay in the natural process or burnt to recover a part of the energy in the thermal form, leading to environmental pollution and loss of value. There is an imperative need to realize that food waste is a bundle of energy, which requires carefully planned recovery without damaging the environment. Conversion of food waste to bio-based liquid or gaseous fuels appears to be an attractive option to meet the escalating demand for fuel and at the same time slowing down the fast-depleting fossil fuel resources. In this context, it is felt appropriate to review the current status of the available technologies which are used in the disposal of food waste in order to identify the variables for process intensification to convert them to fuel keeping in mind the environmental concerns and logistics of utilization. The technologies including incineration, landfill, composting, anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis and biochemical methods have been assessed alongside the recent developing technologies such as hydrothermal carbonization and supercritical water gasification. The critical evaluations of these technologies have been made based on the concepts of life cycle analysis, multi-objective optimization and circular bio-economics which help in assessing the environmental impact. Finally, safety aspects and the way forward are highlighted for future work. This article could form a promising path towards a holistic assessment of efficient food waste to energy conversion for a sustainable development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel and other derivative compounds which could act as biolubricants, can be a suitable alternative for petroleum products, which are less sustainable and harmful to the environment. However, especially when vegetable oils are used as raw materials (for instance Carthamus Tinctorius), these products can show poor oxidative stabilities, depending on their fatty acid composition. Apart from adding antioxidants as additives, a good alternative might be the use of genetically modified seeds to facilitate high ratios of stable fatty acids like oleic acid. The aim of this work was to produce biodiesel and biolubricant from high oleic safflower through transesterification with methanol and 2-ethyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol, respectively. The efficiency of these processes and the quality characterization of biodiesel and biolubricant were assessed. As a result, the biodiesel obtained (HOSBD) complied with the standard, with a high oxidative stability value (8.2 h) and not requiring any antioxidant addition. The biolubricant obtained (HOSBL) showed higher oxidative stability (6.72 h) compared to their equivalents produced from rapeseed (Brassica Napus) or cardoon (Cynara Cardunculus L.). Consequently, two stable bioproducts were obtained and the role of fatty acid composition of raw material was vital (oleic/linoleic ratio had a strong influence on oxidative stability). In that sense, the use of stable raw materials like high oleic safflower might avoid antioxidant addition in biodiesel or biolubricants, which implies a cleaner and more sustainable production. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The quest for an alternative sustainable source without petroleum technology and its refining has prompted the development of biofuels, such as biodiesel, from the transesterification of new or utilized vegetable oil. This work is devoted to the investigation of the transesterification of a used vegetable oil and optimization of the various parameters influencing the synthesis of biodiesel, such as the molar proportion (alcohol/oil), the amount of catalyst added and their weight percentage, the type of alcohol, the temperature T(°C) and the reaction time. From this standpoint, the current work's significant target is to propel the preliminary conditions of the transesterification response of fatty oils to create biodiesel from utilized vegetable oils. Diverse physicochemical characteristics were investigated (in terms of density, viscosity, acidity index, pour point, and flash point) to obtain biodiesel accordingly with international standards and commercial biodiesel. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, the concerns of non-biodegradable mixed plastic waste have been growing and resulting in strengthening of technologies devoted to convert waste into energy. This study examined the technique to extract plastic oil from mixed plastic, non-biodegradable waste. Further, the mechanical characteristics of plastic pyrolysis oil were done. Pyrolysis method was used to extract the oil from plastic waste with screw reactor and the chemical compounds and the characterization of this oil was analyzed. The Fe2O3 doped Al2O3 was dispersed to enhance the quality of Waste pyrolysis oil (PO) by ultrasonication. The performance and emission characteristics of various fuels at different load conditions were analyzed by conducting a series of tests in single cylinder 4 stroke water cooled diesel engine. The benefit of the addition of 25 ppm of Fe2O3 doped Al2O3 in PO was represented graphically. A series of tests was conducted for various brake mean effective pressure of 1.3 bar, 2.6 bar, 3.9 bar and 5.2 bar for the test blends, PO (neat pyrolysis oil) and P25A (25% PO+ 75% diesel with 25 ppm of Al2O3). From the procured results, the addition of the novel nanoparticles increases the production of brake power by 35% with reduced emission of 45% and 60% of HC and CO2 respectively. On the other hand, the NOx emission was reduced by 15% and 9 % than the neat plastic oil and diesel fuel. Further, the usage of the pyrolysis oil at 25% generated the positive effects on both combustion and emission compared to neat PO. © 2021

AB  - Microbial Electrosynthesis (MES) is emerging as a promising technology for the decarbonization of the economy. The use of CO2 as a feedstock, i.e. through carbon capture and utilization, can create attractive business opportunities for the production of third generation biofuels. Achieving highly efficient electron transfer from the cathode to microbes is one of the main challenges hindering the development of MES reactors. It is, therefore, essential to improve biofilm growth for enhanced electron-transfer during bioconversion. In this study we show the first use of 3D bio-printing for microbial electrosynthesis systems, creating a “synthetic biofilm”, containing Sporomusa ovata. The synthetic biofilm greatly improves the acetate production rate while drastically decreasing start-up time. Using H-cell reactors, poised at −0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl, with a synthetic biofilm printed on a carbon cloth electrode, an average acetate productivity of 47±5.1 g day−1 m−2 (0.31±0.55 g L−1 day−1) with a maximum productivity of 104 g day1 m−2 (0.68 g L−1⋅day−1) was achieved. This is an order of magnitude higher than typical S. ovata production rates, and 2–3 fold higher than reactors using specialized cathodes. Start-up of MES reactors typically require days, whereas a high production rate was achieved almost directly after the start-up (±40 h) using the synthetic biofilm. Cyclic voltammetry data showed H2 formation occurred at much higher potentials than in the control reactors, (approx. −550 mV vs. −950 mV for controls). Imaging showed that the synthetic biofilm allowed for dense growth of S. ovata cells at the cathode, increasing electron transfer efficiency and potentially improving the bio-catalyzation of H2. © 2021

AB  - Brazil is one of the major players in the biofuels market worldwide, and its existing biorefining infrastructure can be used as the basis to support the implementation of new advanced biofuel production routes at a large scale. This paper demonstrates the benefits of the integration of both biochemical and thermochemical processes and how this configuration has the potential to overcome the main barriers that the Biomass-to-Liquids (BtL) route currently faces. Important bottlenecks such as the high equipment costs, low industrial process efficiency, and high feedstock prices were studied in detail by assessing a series of production scenarios that take into account the Brazilian context for building new biorefinery plants. By carrying out a techno-economic analysis aided by a simulation framework (the Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery), we evaluated the potential technological synergies of a BtL plant processing sugarcane bagasse and straw integrated into a first-generation sugarcane ethanol distillery. Results in this paper indicate that it is possible to achieve economic feasibility with the implementation of the BtL route in the country. Under a base scenario, a greenfield plant would be very close to the range of economic viability (IRR from 10 to 12% per year), whereas more optimistic economic conditions (e.g., lower CAPEX and higher fuel prices) would induce even better results (IRR greater than 16% per year). Doubling the milling capacity also favors the BtL process, with IRR reaching 20% per year if the best economic conditions are achieved in the Brazilian context. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Corncob is one of the most abundant agro-industrial wastes globally. It represents a bioenergy feedstock of 1500–5500 million tons per year. The shape and size of the corncob are suitable for gasification without pretreatment (size reduction, densification, or drying) in a downdraft gasifier. However, its volatile content (about 80% DAF) can generate high tar content, representing a challenge to adopt this technology. In the present work, an evaluation of the effect of air-steam mixture and calcium carbonate CaCO3 as a promoter of both reforming and gasification reaction was carried out using corn cob without grains as raw material in a 40 kW gasifier. An analysis of variance of four experimental treatments was used to determine the main statistical and interactive effects on the syngas composition, hydrogen yield (yH2), syngas lower heating value (LHVgas), and cold gas efficiency (CGE). Results reveal the highest gasification performance achieved hydrogen production yields of 310 Nml/g, an LHVgas value of 4.8 MJ/Nm3, and cold gas efficiency of 59.18% with steam and CaCO3. Statistical analysis indicated that CaCO3 and steam influence H2 production by increasing 15.8% and 10.8%, respectively, with a CaCO3/biomass ratio of 1% (w/w) and a Steam/biomass ratio of 11% (w/w). Main statistical effects were found for CGE increase of 5% with the addition of steam, 10% with CaCO3, and synergy of 10% using CaCO3 and steam simultaneously. © 2021

AB  - Fusel oil, a by-product of bioethanol production, can be considered as a low-value and renewable material for transforming into value-added products. In this work, the catalytic cracking of fusel oil was studied in a fixed bed reactor to produce light olefins. The operating parameters, such as the temperature, feed flow rate of fusel oil, feedstock, and the co-feeding water, were investigated over a HZSM-5 catalyst in terms of the yields and distribution of the gaseous products. The highest total carbon in the gaseous products with excellent ethylene and propylene selectivity (44.7%, 34.4%, and 28.6%, respectively) were obtained at 550 °C, a feed flow rate of 0.04 mL/min, and 0.02 g of catalyst. After a long time on stream (TOS), the stability of HZSM-5 was slightly decreased due mainly to coke deposition. Thus, the catalytic cracking of fusel oil shows the ability to be converted into light olefins. However, catalyst improvement to enhance the catalytic activity and stability is still required, at the same time, the technical process with economic feasibility still needs more development in order to be realistically useable on an industrial scale in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Finding a way to efficiently utilize this bio-waste resource is a great challenge due to the depletion of traditional fossil fuels and the environmental impact associated to their use. Rice straw is considered as one of the main cereal straws. It is produced in many countries every year in substantial amounts and it has a high ash content and low protein content. Usually, rice straw is burned by farmers causing many adverse effects on the environment and public health. This research investigates the process synthesis of furfural production through the acid-hydrolysis of rice straws. Furfural is a strategic bio-renewable chemical and has gained attention due to its possibility to produce biofuels and bio chemicals. Aspen Plus® simulation package is employed for process simulation, sizing, and analysis. Results of simulations are validated against an experimental work. Optimization through manipulation of several parameters including acid concentration, reaction temperature, acid/rice straw ratio, catalyst concentration, and type of acid to maximize the furfural yield and reaction conversion. A complete flow sheet is synthesized and sensitivity analysis is studied to reach an optimum process concerning environment and economics. The amount of furfural obtained as a final product from the process represents a yield of 73% per 100 kg/hr of rice straw processed. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The development of an efficient electrocatalyst for the direct oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA) has gained considerable interest since AA may be applied as an environment-friendly alternative renewable biofuel in fuel cells. In the present work, the electrocatalytic oxidation of AA was implemented at IrOx immobilized glassy carbon electrode (GC-IrOx) in an acidic medium. Prior to use, the physical properties of GC-IrOx surface were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The XPS analysis revealed that a film of IrOx formed on the GC surface while it was cycled between 0 and 1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) reference electrode in Ir2O3 colloidal solution. The voltammetric investigations of AA oxidation at the GC-IrOx electrode revealed 4-folds higher current compared to a pristine GC electrode suggesting an excellent electrocatalytic performance. The Ir(III)/Ir(IV) redox couple is assigned for catalyzing the reaction. It was found that AA oxidation followed first order kinetics on the GC-IrOx electrode surface. The heterogeneous electron transfer (ET) kinetic study unveiled that AA oxidation reaction followed stepwise mechanism at potentials below 0.38 V and concerted mechanism above this potential with respect to a Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) reference electrode. In this study, the standard rate constant (ko) pertaining to AA oxidation was evaluated as 7.25 × 10−4 cm s − 1. The GC-IrOx electrode exhibited reasonably excellent stability, which mounts the probability of its application as an anode in the AA fuel cells. © 2021

AB  - Direct electrochemical electron transfer (DET) of oxidoreductases has attracted increasing attention in pure and applied bioelectrochemistry (e.g. biosensors and biofuel cells) over the last decades. We report here a systematic study of DET-type bioelectrocatalysis of the membrane-bound redox enzyme fructose dehydrogenase (FDH, Gluconobacter sp.), on variable-length and variably terminated thiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) both on Au(111) and nanoporous gold (NPG) electrodes. FDH on Au(111) modified by short-chain moderately hydrophilic 2-mercaptoethanol (BME) SAMs exhibits the highest DET activities and largest DET-capable fraction. Fitting of theoretical polarization curves to the data and homology modeling/docking of FDH offer further mechanistic insight. The dependence of the DET efficiency of FDH on the length and differently terminated carbon chain is systematically presented. The decreased DET rate with increasing chain length is associated with increasingly unfavourable long-range electron tunnelling, and not with lowered enzyme loading. The porous structure of NPG is favorable for FDH bioelectrocatalysis by improving both efficient enzyme orientation and operational stability. Overall, our study maps systematically the controlled local environmental structural flexibility of the Au/SAM/enzyme/solution interface, a paradigm for thiol modified surfaces in biosensors and bioelectronics. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) strategy using fuels with different reactivity's has attracted attention due to its high thermal efficiency as well as very low NOx and PM emissions in comparison to conventional combustion. As previous studies have shown that the type and amount of low reactivity fuel have a significant contribution to the in-cylinder reactivity, thus RCCI combustion, in this study, Iso-Propanol-Butanol-Ethanol (IBE), which has comparable characteristics to n-butanol and ethanol, is employed as low reactivity fuel (LRF) in a RCCI engine fueled by petroleum based EN590 fuel and commercial biodiesel. The IBE mixture was in volumetric ratios of 3:6:1 as in the fermentation process of butanol, that is to say; 30% Iso-Propanol, 60% Butanol and 10% Ethanol. In each experimental condition, keeping the total energy of the fuel supplied to the engine in conventional combustion mode for each cycle as constant, the premixed ratio (Rp) in case RCCI combustion was applied as 0%, 15%, 30%, 45% and 60% (the amount of LRF in energy basis) over this energy amount. The effect of premixed ratio of IBE on combustion characteristics were investigated in a single-cylinder RCCI engine under different loads with using both petroleum diesel and biodiesel as high-reactivity fuels (HRF), respectively. According to experimental results, a higher in-cylinder pressure was measured by using diesel in both conventional and RCCI mode compared to the use of biodiesel. Considering the peak in-cylinder pressure and rate of heat release, the premixed ratio (Rp) of up to 45% was found as optimum for all loads while it was up to 30%Rp for the NOx emissions. In addition, the biodiesel-fueled RCCI engine produced the lowest smoke opacity in all loads and it gradually decreased by up to 97% with the application of the RCCI strategy. Furthermore, the results showed that a simultaneous reduction in NOx and smoke opacity could be obtained under 60% load and up to 30% Rp with a marginal increase in unburned HC emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fast hydrothermal liquefaction of acid-washed Cladophora socialis macroalgae has been studied over homogeneous (KOH, K2CO3, H3PO4, HCOOH) and heterogeneous (H-ZSM-5, Raney Ni, Ru/C, Fe metal) catalysts in a batch reactor at 350 °C. Biocrude with maximum yield (36.2%) and energy density (37.1 MJ kg−1) and minimum heteroatom contents (3.8% N and 10.1% O) were achieved with metallic Fe. GC–MS indicates reduction in content of carbonyls, acids and N-containing substances and increase in levels of phenols and hydrocarbons in biocrude while 1H NMR suggests the enhanced formation of oxygenated/nitrogenous compounds in aqueous phase over Fe catalyst compared to non-catalytic test. Such carbonyls and acids removal was proposed to occur via hydride reduction and decarboxylation pathways, respectively. GPC and TAN confirm vast improvement in stability and corrosiveness properties of Fe-catalyzed biocrude. Regeneration of used catalyst has been conducted and the regenerated catalyst exhibited slight deactivation, likely due to sintering of Fe particles. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is typically produced from a wide variety of edible vegetable oils. The cost of biofuels is projected to rise in the future as an alternative and ecologically suitable replacement to traditional fuel. Reliable and inexpensive raw materials, including meat processing by-products or waste animal fats, have rapidly attracted interest in biodiesel production. The operational and reaction parameters play an important role in the conversion of processes and biodiesel yield. Kinetic models explain the reaction rate and process optimization to improve the biodiesel conversion process. The process intensification approaches applied by different researchers are illustrated in the current study. This paper proposes a groundbreaking solution to stepping up biodiesel development by utilizing a coalescer reactor and a preliminary review to justify the solution's potential for further analysis. Optimization techniques and kinetics studies used to enhance biodiesel production from renewable sources are explored in the current review paper. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) and exogenous accelerants can augment anaerobic digestion performance. Herein, MECs and coconut-shell-derived bio-based carbon (CBC) accelerant are adopted to strengthen anaerobic co-digestion of cow manure and aloe peel waste. The MEC with the voltage of 0.6 V and CBC accelerant of 0.15 wt.% gained the highest cumulative biogas yield (444.20 NmL/g VS) and chemical oxygen demand removal rate (75.46%), which are 80.25% and 58.33% higher than those (246.44 NmL/g VS, 47.66%) of the blank group, respectively. The digestates embodied a utilization potential with thermogravimetric loss of 37.12%–50.67% and total nutrient content of 35.36–51.58 g/kg. These results benefited from excellent electrocatalytic activity of MECs and physicochemical properties of CBC accelerant. A general strategy for understanding improved methanogenesis was proposed based on integrated effects of MECs and CBC accelerant. This work will shed light on development of anaerobic co-digestion by combining MECs and bio-based carbon accelerants. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Despite biofuels’ significance in substituting petroleum products in the transportation sector, many countries, including Ethiopia, have not taken advantage of their biomass resources potential to develop biofuel. This is attributed to several challenges, in which the economic unattractiveness, especially the requirement of excessively high initial investment costs, is the major one. To address this challenge, a quantitative-based design and planning of the biomass-to-biofuel supply chain (BBSC), which is backed by optimization, is compulsory. Henceforth, this study intends to develop an optimization model that seeks to maximize the profit and minimize the investment cost of the BBSC. The optimization model is applied to the real case of Ethiopia's BBSC to provide a planning support tool for the policy-makers over a 20-year horizon. Although several economic optimization models developed so far, this contribution broadens the preceding research endeavors by considering the following efforts simultaneously. An integrated strategic-tactical level model is developed to prevent non-optimal and infeasible results, which might arise from separate models. Adverse to the integrated strategic-tactical models developed so far, a multi-product BBSC that produces bioethanol and biodiesel with the associated co-products and a comprehensive supply chain, which incorporates a decentralized preprocessing unit, along with the other relevant components, is considered. The investment decisions related to location, technology, and capacity of facilities happen on yearly basis, unlike many studies that consider this decision only at the beginning of the planning period. The model size boosts as it is a real and comprehensive national-level case study.

AB  - Organic acids produced during the fermentation of lactic acid bacteria inhibit cellular growth and the production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO). Lactobacillus reuteri JH83, which has an increase of 18.6% in organic acid resistance, was obtained through electron beam irradiation mutagenesis irrelevant to the problem of genetically modified organisms. The maximum bioconversion of 1,3-PDO in fed-batch fermentation using pure glycerol by L. reuteri JH83 was 93.2 g/L at 72 h, and the productivity was 1.29 g/L·h, which achieved an increase by 34.6%, compared to that of the wild-type strain. In addition, the result of fed-batch fermentation for the production of 1,3-PDO using crude glycerol was not significantly different from that of pure glycerol. Additionally, transcriptome analysis confirmed changes in the expression levels of sucrose phosphorylase, which is a major facilitator superfamily transporter, and muramyl ligase family proteins, which protect lactic acid bacteria from various stressors, such as organic acids. © 2021

AB  - In the last few decades, production of alternative fuels has been a global concern among the environmental scientists in view of scarcity of fossil fuels and increasing global warming. Biodiesels are being synthesized as green fuel by transesterification of different oils and fats over diverse synthetically developed novel heterogeneous catalysts. In this present work,a magnetically reusable hybrid nanocatalyst of basic nature has been designed for the production of biodiesels by transesteriﬁcation of waste corn oil and rapeseed oil in presence of methanol. During the synthesis of catalyst, magnetic CuFe2O4 nanoparticles were amalgamated with graphene oxide (GO) by using pistachio leaf extract and subsequently MgO nanoparticles were impregnated over it. The catalyst was physicochemically characterized by FT-IR, SEM, TEM, EDX, elemental mapping, XRD, VSM and TGA studies. The reaction parameters like reaction time, the methanol/oil molar ratio and the catalyst loading were optimized through Response Surface Methodology (RSM) using Box-Behnken experimental design. In addition, the catalysts was magnetically retrieved quite easily and reused five times in succession without considerable loss in its reactivity in the transesteriﬁcation reaction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wastewater management and its treatment have revolutionized the industry sector into many innovative techniques. However, the cost of recycling via chemical treatment has major issues especially in economically poor sectors. On the offset, one of the most viable and economical techniques to clean wastewater is by growing microalgae in it. Since wastewater is rich in nitrates, phosphates and other trace elements, the environment is suitable for the growth of microalgae. On the other side, the cost of harvesting microalgae for its secondary metabolites is burgeoning. While simultaneously growing of microalgae in photobioreactors requires regular feeding of the nutrients and maintenance which increases the cost of operation and hence cost of its end products. The growth of microalgae in waste waters makes the process not only economical but they also manufacture more amounts of value added products. However, harvesting of these values added products is still a cumbersome task. On the offset, it has been observed that pretreating the microalgal biomass with ultrasonication allows easy oozing of the secondary metabolites like oil, proteins, carbohydrates and methane at much lower cost than that required for their extraction. Among microalgae diatoms are more robust and have immense crude oil and are rich in various value added products. However, due to their thick silica walls they do not ooze the metabolites until the mechanical force on their walls reaches certain threshold energy. In this review recycling of wastewater using microalgae and its pretreatment via ultrasonication with special reference to diatoms is critically discussed. Perspectives on circular bioeconomy and knowledge gaps for employing microalgae to recycle wastewater have been comprehensively narrated. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this paper, the microwave-assisted pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris was studied by thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) using absorbent SiC and catalyst TiO2 (compound additive). The effects of compound additive on microwave pyrolysis characteristics, products yield and composition of C. vulgaris were studied under different addition amounts (5%, 10% and 15%) and the mixing ratios (SiC/TiO2 = 10:0, 7:3, 5:5, 3:7, 0:10) of compound additive. The pyrolytic bio-oil were studied by GC-MS analysis. The results showed that the effect of 5% addition amount was better when the mixing ratio was SiC/TiO2 = 5:5 (S5T5). S7T3, S3T7 and S0T10 with 10% addition groups showed a good promoting effect on the pyrolysis of C. vulgaris. The pure TiO2 experimental group with 5% addition had the highest bio-oil yield. With the increase of the TiO2 content in the compound additive at same addition amount, the yield of bio-oil increased. The bio-oil yield of S7T3 and S5T5 experimental groups gradually increased with the increase of addition amount, while that of S3T7 group decreased at first and then increased. SiC, TiO2 and compound additive promote the production of ketones and reduce the acidic substances in bio-oil. Compound additive experimental group had the least amount of acid substances in the pyrolysis bio-oil. © 2021 Energy Institute

AB  - Carbon-based support catalysts are beneficial on account of low material cost, prominent surface area, and stability at high temperature. In this study, biochar derived activated carbon (AC) supported metal catalysts were tested for hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of alkali lignin. Catalytic HTL of alkali lignin was carried out at various temperatures (260 to 300 °C) with varying catalysts quantity (5 to 20 wt%), and solvents (water, ethanol, methanol) for 15 min reaction time. As the reaction temperature increased from 260 to 300 °C, conversion increased from 76.2 to 85.5 wt%. Bimetallic catalyst Ni-Co/AC with ethanol solvent system at 280 °C gave highest bio-oil yield (72.0 wt%). Lignin catalytic depolymerization produces monomer phenolic compounds due to efficient breaking of the lignin macromolecule. Thus, the presence of catalyst and solvent increased the cleavage of β-O-4 bonds resulting in increased selectivity towards vanillin (32.3–36.2%). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a novel carbon-based solid acid catalyst was synthesized by carbonization of de-oiled microalgal biomass followed by sulfonation. The effect of catalyst synthesis conditions such as carbonization temperature, sulfonation time, and H2SO4 concentration on the surface acidity of the catalyst and free fatty acid conversion was determined. The de-oiled microalgal biomass-based solid acid (DMB) catalyst was predominantly composed of carboxylic, phenolic, and sulfonic groups as indicated by the FTIR analysis and supported by the XPS analysis. The catalyst was further characterized by various methods to determine its physiochemical properties. A maximum fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield of 94.23% for microalgal oil (AO) and 96.25% for waste cooking oil (WCO) was obtained under optimized transesterification conditions. The catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity (FAME yield &gt;90%) until the fourth cycle. Most of the biodiesel properties were within the permissible limit of EN 14,212 and ASTM D6751 standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pt–Sn–Ce/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized by the impregnation method and used to produce aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs)-rich bio-oil via catalytic fast pyrolysis of cellulose. The upgraded products were on-line analyzed by pyrolysis-comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC × GC/MS). It was found that Pt–Sn–Ce/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were effective for improving the relative content of AHs in bio-oil. Especially, Pt–Sn–Ce/γ-Al2O3 contributed the highest AHs content (85.82%), which was 3 times than that of γ-Al2O3, and increased 85.44% compared with non-catalytic. In addition, Pt–Sn–Ce/γ-Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 can generate the highest monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) with the relative content of 60.24% and 51.92%, respectively. Pt–Sn–Ce/γ-Al2O3 catalyst can be reused five times with stable catalytic activity to produce AHs-rich bio-oil. © 2021 Energy Institute

AB  - Biodiesel has been emerging as a potential and promising biofuel for the strategy of reducing toxic emissions and improving engine performance. Computational methods aiming to offer numerical solutions were inevitable as a study methodology which was sometimes considered the only practical method. Artificial neural networks (ANN) were data-processing systems, which were used to tackle many issues in engineering and science, especially in some fields where there was a failure of the conventional modeling approaches. Thus, it was believed that the best choice was the development of a novel approach like the ANN model to anticipate engine performance and exhaust emissions with high accuracy. In this review paper, the structure and applicability of the ANN model were comprehensively evaluated. More importantly, the use of ANN with trained, tested, and validated data was introduced to determine the performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fueled with biodiesel-based fuel. In general, the ANN model could supply a relatively high determination coefficient as compared between predicted results and experimental data, showing that the ANN model could have a good ability to predict the engine behaviors with an accuracy higher than 95%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Resource recovery from piggery biogas slurry has become an inevitable demand for sustainable development of pig industry. Microalgae show great potential in recovering nitrogen and phosphorus from piggery slurry, but struggle to utilize organic pollutants, as most of them are inert components (e.g., humic acids, HAs). In this study, nano-TiO2 was used to enhance the utilization of HAs by microalgae from piggery biogas slurry. Results showed that the optimal conditions for microalgal growth and HAs removal by the microalgae-TiO2 coupling system were TiO2 dosage of 0.30 g/L, microalgal inoculation concentration of 0.40 g/L, light intensity of 360 µmol photon/(m2·s) and temperature of 30 °C, with the microalgal chlorophyll concentration of 6.51 mg/L and HAs removal efficiency of 50.14%. Analysis of HAs composition variations in the piggery biogas slurry indicated that the decrease of HAs was caused by their decomposition into small molecules under the photocatalytic reactions of TiO2. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Commercial production of jet fuel from biobased feedstocks is still encumbering, mainly due to their high production cost and competition with food resources. Pennycress oilseed is a potential jet fuel feedstock which can be supplied at a lower price compared to similar oilseeds, such as soybean and canola. However, the techno-economics of pennycress-based jet fuel production needs to be evaluated. The objective of this study was to assess the technical feasibility and costs of hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) production from pennycress. The production capacity was considered to be 18.9 million L/yr (5 million gal/yr). The analysis considered pennycress grain handling and conditioning, oil extraction and conversion to HRJ and byproducts, i.e., LPG, naphtha and green diesel, through hydroprocessing technology, as well as pennycress meal processing as boiler fuel and wastewater treatment. Total investment for establishing the HRJ biorefinery at the selected capacity was estimated to be 90.8 million USD. Minimum selling price (MSP) of HRJ was estimated to be 1.2 USD/L, which was comparable to the MSP of HRJ from similar oilseeds, including soybean and canola. It could also be further reduced by supplying pennycress grain at a lower price, increasing the oil content and increasing the production capacity of the biorefinery. The outcomes of this research would help establish the performance targets needed to reach the economic viability of HRJ production from pennycress at the commercial scale. © 2021

AB  - Over the years, algae have found wide scope of utility in a variety of environmentally beneficial processes like biofuel production, removal of heavy metals from wastewater sources for potential bioremediation, monitoring water pollution and source of animal nutrition. However, the conventional harvesting methods pose a set-back in terms of energy, cost and operational complications due to the small size of microalgae. Of all the processes, harvesting alone corresponds to approximately 30% of the total production costs. Recent advancements in the microalgal technology have brought many efficient techniques into use for improved recovery of microalgae. This review comprehends the development, principle, influencing parameters and directions to future research of one of the state-of-the-art approaches for harvesting microalgae, electrochemical technology. Though this area was previously explored for its application in wastewater treatment, it has lately gained momentum in the field of microalgae due to its economic efficiency. This paper highlights the three prime processes used to yield microalgae namely electroflocculation, electroflotation and a combined electrocoagulation-flotation (ECF) system. Several encroachments and strategies among these techniques have also been elucidated. The review focusses on the effect of most significant process controlling parameters such as reactor and electrode design, various surface properties of microalgae, current, pH, salinity and agitation that influence harvesting. In addition, the economy and energy aspects that emphasize the welfares of this technology over others have been extensively discussed. The overall work aims to provide an insight into the electrochemical methods, their challenges and opportunities that might be beneficial for carrying out further research and scope for industrial applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) is a promising waste treatment technology for streams from wine industry, which can eliminate its pollution and produce biofuels simultaneously. In this study, we investigated the influence of catalyst concentration and temperature for efficient SCWG so as to shift the product distribution toward more desirable compounds. Also, experiments have been demonstrated to examine the effect of the group 1A carbonates (Li2CO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3, and Cs2CO3). Wine industry wastes have been successfully gasified and the products were identified by using chromatographic methods. As going down from top to bottom in group 1A by increasing reaction temperature, the highest H2 and CH4 yields were obtained with Cs2CO3 at 600 °C. These results support the development of the reaction conditions by effective catalysts to contribute to the solution of the global bioenergy shortage and effective waste management of the industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels in the form of bio-oil and biochar have been produced by microwave heating of corn stover. Different adsorbents such as silicon carbide (SiC) and activated carbon (AC) with different ratios (10%, 20%, and 30%) to corn stover are investigated with the aims of enhancing the absorption of the microwave, maximizing the yields of the desirable products i.e. bio-oil followed by biochar as well as improving their qualities. Use of both the adsorbents improved the heating performance through increase in the maximal temperature and heating rate by 170 °C and 36 °C/min respectively compared to without adsorbent. Use of AC increased the yield of bio-oil up to 45 wt% while SiC increased the gas yields up to a maximum value of 48 wt%. The better physical properties such as 37%, 5.3, 2.9 mPa s, and 1 g/mL for water content, pH, viscosity and density respectively of bio-oil were obtained when using AC as an adsorbent. Also, use of AC helped in producing bio-oils which contained higher carbon and hydrogen contents as well as high calorific value (17 MJ/kg). Similarly, use of AC increased the contents of hydrocarbons and phenols in the bio-oil up to 36% and 28% respectively with low oxygen-containing compounds (2%). Also, use of AC produced the biochar having cleanest pores that were almost free of carbon-like impurities with a higher surface area of the pore (105.2 m2/g). In addition, biochar having low ash content, high carbon content, and calorific value (28 MJ/kg) were achieved. The net energy recovery with respect to raw corn stover was calculated to be of maximum value i.e., 55% when using AC. The AC and SiC were reused for further runs of the experiments (5 times) with few changes in the heating behavior and the yields of the pyrolytic products. © 2021 Energy Institute

AB  - The development of an alternate environmental friendly electrocatalyst suitable to replace the function of the ferrocene, ferricyanide and prussian blue-based redox-mediators is a challenging research interest. Herein, we introduced a novel method for synthesis of a highly redox-active surface-confined Hydroquinone on MWCNT modified glassy carbon electrode surface, GCE/MWCNT@H2Q using the earth-abundant lignocellulose-biomass product, syringaldehyde (Syn) by one-step potential cycling and potentiostatic polarization method in pH 7 phosphate buffer solution that can show an efficient ascorbic acid electrocatalytic signal better than the conventional redox-mediators suitable to use as an anode in biofuel cell and selective electrochemical sensor applications in neutral pH solution. This new electrode showed a well-defined redox peak at Eo′ = −0.15 V(A2/C2) and 0.0 V(A3/C3) vs Ag/AgCl corresponding to the redox-active molecular species of H2Q and its polymerized product, Poly-H2Q. Based on various physicochemical techniques like Raman, IR, TGA, DTA, TEM, GC–MS, H1-NMR and scanning electrochemical microscope imaging using substrate generation/tip-collection mode, it has been revealed that Syn-precursor underwent a demethoxylation and hydration upon the electrochemical preparation condition. It has been proposed that the Poly-H2Q is an active site for the selective electrocatalytic oxidation of AA in a neutral pH solution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Livestock manures significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and soil contamination if not valorised or disposed of properly. Meanwhile, hydrothermal liquefaction has emerged as a promising technology for the conversion of wet wastes into value-added products. As such, this study investigates the potential of hydrothermal liquefaction of camel manure and subsequent upgrading into drop-in fuels in Qatar. Experimental characterisation of manure samples is conducted, while a small-scale plant is simulated and evaluated using Aspen Plus®. Excess treated wastewater of Qatar is utilised as an alternative to fresh water in the process, while power is completely generated on-site. The demonstrated results are promising; whereby, a biocrude yield of 37.9% (on dry and ash-free basis) is achieved, while the biocrude is upgraded into a high-quality bio-gasoline. The produced bio-gasoline contributes to a 7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions relative to conventional gasoline. The project capital investment is estimated to be 38 M$, while the bio-gasoline's minimum selling price is at 0.87 $/kg, which is still above the market price of conventional gasoline in Qatar (∼0.6 $/kg). However, the conducted sensitivity analysis indicates that scaling-up the plant by 5-fold can shift the fuel's minimum selling price below the average market price. As such, it has a high potential to be locally commercialised especially at times of petroleum price hikes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With biofuels market expanding, amines, as an important compound class in biofuels, are attracting increasing attention. The pyrolysis of n-propylamine (NPA) was studied in a flow tube using tunable synchrotron photoionization and molecular-beam mass spectrometry techniques. 28 and 30 species, including nitrogenous compounds and hydrocarbons, were identified and quantified at 30 and 760 Torr, respectively. 1,3-Cyclopentadiene, 1,4-pentadiene, 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene and benzene, were newly detected compared with previous studies of methylamine and ethylamine. HCN, NH3, N2 and methanimine were detected as the dominant nitrogenous products. Moreover, minor aliphatic and unsaturated amines were also identified, such as methylamine, ethylamine and acetaldimine. Ethylene achieved at the highest level among hydrocarbon products. With the pressure increasing, the onset temperature of NPA pyrolysis shifts towards low temperature region and NPA decomposes faster. A comprehensive detailed kinetic model involving 405 species and 2668 reactions was developed with reasonable predictions. According to rate-of-production analysis, H-abstractions, especially at Cα position of NPA, are the major consumption pathways of NPA. In addition, unimolecular reaction breaking Cα-Cβ bond is the important consumption channel of NPA at 30 Torr, while its positive effect is seriously weakened at 760 Torr. The H-abstraction at Cα (NPA+H[dbnd]CH3CH2CHNH2+H2) plays a leading role for NPA consumption at 760 Torr. The reactions, CH3+CH3=C2H5+H and CH3CHCHNH2+H[dbnd]CH2CHCHNH2+H2, tend to present inhibiting effects on NPA consumption at 30 and 760 Torr, respectively. These results could provide a theoretical basis for further combustion kinetic studies of biofuels and amine fuels. © 2021

AB  - In order to determine the synergistic effects of the mixed additives of Fe and other catalysts on the yields and characteristics of bio-oil products, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of pinewood sawdust (PW) was performed at 300 °C for 30 min (biomass/water mass ratio = 1:10) in the presence of metallic iron (Fe), other homogeneous/heterogeneous catalysts (Na2CO3, NaOH, FeSO4, MgO, Ru/C, FeS), as well as mixed additives. The results indicated that the metallic Fe could increase the yield and promote the degree of hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil products. Noticeable synergistic effects on improving the bio-oil yields were found in the presence of mixed additives of Fe and an alkali catalyst (Na2CO3/NaOH) or FeS. The maximum bio-oil yield and the most energy recovery from bio-oil (81%) were obtained with Fe + Na2CO3. In addition, the combination of Fe + Ru/C produced bio-oil with the highest carbon and hydrogen contents, the highest HHV (30.93 MJ/kg), as well as the lowest contents of oxygenated compounds and the largest amount of hydrocarbons. In summary, this work demonstrates the synergistic effects of the mixed additives of Fe and several catalysts (Na2CO3, FeS and Ru/C) in HTL of woody biomass, promoting both yields and quality of bio-oil products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A green heterogeneous acid catalyst derived from agro-industrial waste obtained from ginger straw was prepared via partial carbonization, followed by sulfonation using sulfuric acid. Three variables, including the carbonization temperature, carbonization time and sulfonation temperature, were optimized to achieve the ideal preparation conditions and the as-synthesized catalyst was characterized using X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, N2 adsorption-desorption and acid density studies to reveal the relationship between its catalytic performance and physical-chemical properties. The results show that the ginger straw-based catalyst prepared via carbonization for 60 min at 350 °C, followed by sulfonation at 105 °C, has an amorphous carbon structure with an –SO3H group density of 1.05 mmol/g. In addition, the catalyst exhibits thermal stability up to 200 °C and satisfactory catalytic performance (93.2% conversion) during the esterification of oleic acid using methanol under the optimized reaction conditions (9:1 M ratio of methanol to oleic acid; catalyst loading, 7 wt%; reaction temperature, 64 °C; reaction time, 210 min). Although its catalytic activity was later found to decrease with cycling, the spent catalyst remains stable after the 5th cycle with a conversion of 65.6%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increase in global population size over the past 100 decades has doubled the requirements for energy resources. To mitigate the limited fossil fuel available, new clean energy sources being environmental sustainable for replacement of traditional energy sources are explored to supplement the current scarcity. Biomass containing lignin and cellulose is the main raw material to replace fossil energy given its abundance and lower emission of greenhouse gases and NOx when transformed into energy. Bacteria, fungi and algae decompose lignocellulose leading to generation of hydrogen, methane, bioethanol and biodiesel being the clean energy used for heating, power generation and the automobile industry. Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) uses microorganisms to decompose biomass in wastewater to generate electricity and remove heavy metals in wastewater. Biomass contains cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and other biomacromolecules which need hydrolyzation for conversion into small molecules by corresponding enzymes in order to be utilized by microorganisms. This paper discusses microbial decomposition of biomass into clean energy and the five major ways of clean energy production, and its economic benefits for future renewable energy security. © 2021

AB  - Free fatty acids (FFAs) are a useful feedstock for a range of industrial chemical synthesis applications. However, efficiently converting FFAs to molecules for biofuel and other high-value chemicals requires more efficient and cost-effective catalysts. Cytochrome P450 fatty acid peroxygenases (CYP152) have a unique chemistry that allows use of the peroxide shunt pathway for biochemical conversion of FFAs. Known CYP152s are heat labile, however, requiring characterization of more thermotolerant versions for use in industrial applications. A fatty acid peroxygenase from Bacillus methanolicus (CYP152K6) was shown here to have a higher optimal reaction temperature than OleT (CYP152L1). CYP152K6 was stable up to 50 °C and showed great stability in 3% acetone and dimethylformamide. Stability in solvents helps the enzyme's substrates remain soluble in solution for more efficient catalysis, and heat stability allows enzymes to remain active longer during industrial processes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Following the importance of the conversion of lignin compounds into beneficial products, a new cleaner production strategy is proposed. To this end, simulated lignin-derived syngas was utilized instead of pure hydrogen for anisole and cyclohexanone conversion over a platinum catalyst. The experiments at 300–400 °C and 1–15 bar are addressed. The impact of weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is also investigated. The new strategy offers high activity, selectivity, and yield for the conversion of anisole and cyclohexanone to possibly value-added products. Anisole conversion results in the formation of phenol, cyclohexanone, and methylated phenols. Cyclohexanone reaction produces cyclohexane, cyclohexene, benzene, cresols, phenol, and toluene. Increasing reaction temperature and pressure enhances the conversion of the reactants while increasing WHSV decreases the conversion. The highest anisole (87.44%) and cyclohexanone (77.02%) conversions were obtained at 400 °C, 15 bar, and the smallest WHSV. Temperature, pressure, and WHSV had major effects on the conversions and product distributions. The highest hydrocarbon yields and carbon-to-oxygen ratio enhancement (C/O RE) were managed at different conditions for anisole and cyclohexanone. The present study indicates that the new syngas-assisted strategy could be utilized for the conversion of lignin-derived compounds to hydrocarbons and possibly value-added products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing travel demand, incomplete combustion of fuel in an engine, vehicle exhaust emissions such as NOx, CO and particular matter and global warming urge the fuel modification methods by using nano additives and alternative fuel. Suitable preparation method, characterization and fuel additive application of nickel-copper-carbide nanocomposite (Ni–CuC NC) have been rarely reported due to lack of research. On this ground, the present research illustrated the synthesis of nickel-copper bimetallic nanoparticles (Ni–Cu BNPs) with copper chloride (CuCl2) and nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) salt precursors in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Followed by the reinforcement of calcium carbide (CaC2) with Ni–Cu BNPs to prepare Ni–CuC nanocomposite via hydrothermal approach. Structural composition and morphological analysis of the Ni–CuC nanocomposite was studied by XRD and SEM respectively. Physical and combustion fuel properties were investigated at 20, 40, 60 and 80 ppm concentration of Ni–Cu BNPs and Ni–CuC nanocomposite respectively for fuel-efficiency. Flash and fire point of diesel fuel in the absence of additives was observed as 78 and 82 °C respectively. Whereas, 80 ppm fuel blend of Ni–CuC and Ni–Cu show a remarkable decrease in flash point up to 69 and 72 °C respectively. The decreasing trend for fire point observed up to 72 and 74 °C respectively. A tremendous recorded decrease in kinematic viscosity was 1.51 and 1.75 m2/s with Ni–CuC and Ni–Cu. Ni–Cu BNPs and Ni–CuC nanocomposite in term of fuel efficiency and environment friendly emission could be recognized as potential candidates in diesel. Future work on Ni–Cu BNPs and Ni–CuC nanocomposite as fuel additives for enhancing fuel or biofuel parameters as a photocatalyst for various dye removal in wastewater treatment, as sensing agent in sensing technology as well as for chemical reaction catalysis could be encouraged. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels may reduce road transport carbon intensity; however, it is uncertain whether displacing fossil diesel would alter the engine-derived particulate toxicity. The primary objective of this work was to determine whether there is a fuel effect on the comparative in vitro toxicity of biodiesel exhaust particulates relative to those from fossil diesel. A secondary aim was to determine qualitatively whether the observed outcome is related to the organic phase, namely Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). In vitro and acellular exposure studies were recovered from a literature survey following the PRISMA framework. Biological responses attributable to biodiesel and paired fossil diesel particles, including particle-extracts were selected. To qualify for inclusion, either of the paired responses must differ statistically significantly (p < 0.05) from the control or each other. Paired responses were assigned to one-of-five categories which best represents the pathophysiological role of the biomarker: inflammation, oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and mutagenicity. Biodiesel reduced particle toxicity in two-thirds of paired responses, however, there were large differences between biodiesels for category-specific biomarkers. Particles derived from Rapeseed oil Methyl Ester (RME) were less inflammatory, whereas Soybean oil Methyl Ester (SME) particles were more inflammatory than fossil diesel on average. Conversely, SME reduced oxidative stress while few trends emerged for mutagenicity and genotoxicity. The largest fuel effect was observed for cytotoxicity: Waste Cooking Oil Methyl Ester (WCOME) increased and Palm oil Methyl Ester (PME) decreased particle cytotoxicity. Particle-phase PAH emissions compiled on a mass-of-soot basis also followed this trend, however, literature focusing on both these aspects is limited; careful consideration of fuel composition and use of normal primary human cell types and omics technologies, could resolve this open question. This assessment systematically compares biological responses from particulate only exposure, with co-exposure necessarily excluded due to an absence of understanding of how gaseous components modify particulate toxicity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Torrefaction is a thermochemical process used to convert the biomass into solid fuel. In this study, torrefaction increased the raw microalgal biomass’ energy content from 20.22 MJ⋅kg−1 to 27.93 MJ⋅kg−1. To determine if more energy is produced than energy consumption from torrefaction, this study identified the energy balance of torrefied microalgal biomass production based on a life cycle approach. The energy analysis showed that, among all processes, torrefaction had the least amount of energy demand. The experimental setup, defined as scenario A, revealed that the principal source of energy demand, about 85%, was consumed on the microalgal growth using a photobioreactor system. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine the varying energy demand for torrefied microalgal biomass production. The different types of cultivation methods and various production scales were considered in scenarios B to D. Scenario D, which represented the commercial production-scale, the energy demand drastically decreased by 59.46% as compared to the experimental setup (scenario A). The open-pond cultivation system resulted in the least energy requirement, regardless of the production scale (scenarios B and C) among all the given scenarios. Unlike scenarios A and D, scenarios B and C identified the drying process to consume a high amount of energy. All the scenarios have shown an energy demand deficit. Therefore, efforts to decrease the energy demand on the upstream processes are needed to make the torrefied microalgal biomass a viable alternative energy source. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Two new VO(II) complexes have been synthesized from ligands based on cyanoacetohydrazide (H2L1 &amp; H2L2). Variable analytical and spectral methods have elucidated these complexes as well as their original ligands. IR, 1H NMR, UV-Vis, Mass, EPR, SEM, EDX, XRD and elemental analysis were the practical techniques applied for characterization. Binegative tetradentate mode was suggested within (VO)2-L1 complex, while neutral tetradentate mode was suggested within (VO)2-H2L2 complex. The geometry of complexes was suggested according to VU-Vis spectra as well as EPR spectra to be a square-pyramidal form. In order to optimize their structural forms and extract critical quantum parameters, the DFT analysis was introduced under valence double-zeta polarized base set (6-31G*). The extracted physical parameters suggest that, the (VO)2-L1 complex has excellent characteristics. Hirshfeld's surface properties, on the other hand, indicate its distinctive crystal properties. The (VO)2-L1 complex was therefore selected to catalyze the synthesis of biodiesel via transesterification processes from waste frying oil. In particular, the physical characteristics and combustion efficiency of the synthesized biofuel suggest its high quality due to absence of Cd and Pb metals. The valuable goal attained in this study is to perform a catalytic function for selected VO(II) complex in preparing an economical product as a biofuel through a low cost and safe process. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present research project, the energy crop peelu non-edible oil was investigated as a potential source for fatty acid methyl esters production, using hybrid metallic nano-particles. The energy crop peelu is an evergreen shrubby plant distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Naturally, the plant has having a worthy fates masses, had proceeded an optimum results for quantitative and qualitative methyl esters production, using hybrid metallic nano-particles poly-N-isopropylacrylamide “PNIPAM-Cu, PNIPAM-Pd & PNIPAM-Cu@Pd”. Whereas, the carboxyl functionalized P(NIPAM) microgels was synthesized via soap free emulsion polymerization, containing poly-N-isopropyl acrylamide and acrylic acid. The proposed thiol group was then introduced via carbodiimide mediated imide bond between the carboxyl group of carboxyl functionalized microgels and the amine from amino-ethanethiol. The Copper, Palladium and Copper@Palladium nano-particles were mixed-up into thiol-functionalized Poly-N-isopropylacrylamide microgels through metals thiol linkage. The hybrid metallic nano-particles were characterized using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) & Fourier Transfer Infra-Red (FT-IR) for rectification. The experimentation protocol for methyl esters synthesis using various concentrations of hybrid metallic nano-particles in conversion was adjusted to 1:6 oil to methanol molar ratio, temperature 60 °C and reaction time 2 h and stirring 600 rpm, respectively. The optimum yield of methyl esters was reported 92.20 against 1.5gm PNIPAM-Cu@Pd nano-particle. The chemical and structural status of synthesized methyl esters were characterized by Gas Chromatography & Mass Spectroscopy (GC&MS), FT-IR & Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) NMR spectroscopes. The physico-chemical properties of peelu crop methyl esters were analyzed, checked and compared with the international American Standards for Testing Materials (ASTM) & European Union (EN) standards, accordingly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, Botryococcus sp. was the feedstock for the ethanol and methyl ester production. In the one-way method, the biomass was utilized for the optimization of sugar recovery process in which maximum sugar recovery was obtained when using 0.3 N H2SO4 and autoclave conditions for 15 min. At the end of fermentation, the yield of 93% of ethanol was obtained. In situ transesterification of spent biomass for methyl ester production was performed using dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as solvent and the optimum conditions were 5 mL DMC/g biomass, 12% (w/w) catalyst, 1% (w/w) water addition, 50 °C and 36 h. In addition to methyl ester as a main product, glycerol carbonate, glycerol dicarbonate and glycerol were also formed as by-products which have high industrial values. The study further compared the one-way method and the integrated method in which Botryococcus sp. showed higher efficiency on both bioethanol and methyl ester production using integrated method. Hence, Botryococcus sp. could be efficiently utilized as feedstock for the microalgae biorefinery which can save cost and allow for multiple biofuels production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current investigation highlighted the capability of the Chlorella vulgaris growth in the artificial wastewater with different concentration of NaCl incorporated with difference concentration of nanoparticle ZnO and Fe2O3. Chlorella vulgaris cultured with ZnO and Fe2O3 at the concentration of 5 mg/L, 10 mg/L, 20 mg/L and 50 mg/L. The characterization of the nanoparticles was performed through analytical technique. This study found that, the nutrient removal was effective on ZnO compared to Fe2O3 against total nitrogen and total phosphorous. Further, the NaCl concentration in the wastewater affects the growth of the microalgae and biofuel production. With regard to the biomass concentration, the 20 mg/L ZnO and 50 mg/L Fe2O3 reported highest yield of 2.08 g/L and 2.02 g/L. On the other hand, the maximum lipid accumulation of ZnO and Fe2O3 were 14.25 wt% and 13.8 wt%. Secondly, the procured lipids were processed through transesterification process and characterized by Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Compelling all the above it is concluded that the Chlorella vulgaris can be the suitable candidate for treatment of wastewater and production of bio-fuel. © 2021

AB  - Designing highly active non-noble metal catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation of renewable biomass into value added biofuels and chemicals is highly desirable, but still remains a challenging task. In this work, flower-like Ni catalysts supported on mixed metal oxides (MMO) were fabricated by calcination and reduction of NiZnAl layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors. The optimized Ni0.5Zn1.5Al1-MMO catalyst displayed excellent hydrodeoxygenation catalytic activity for lignin derivatives at 130 °C, being much superior with the catalysts prepared by impregnation and coprecipitation method, as well as most of the reported non-noble catalysts. The superior activity originated from the synergetic effect of large specific surface area of the support, strong metal-support interaction and more acid sites. This research provides a feasible route for the constructing efficient hydrodeoxygenation catalysts by tuning the physicochemical property and composition of the catalyst. © 2021

AB  - Paper sludge is a solid waste by-product abundantly produced in the paper industry and contains fine minerals and lignocellulosic biomass. In this contribution, the ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of paper sludge with a high mineral content of ca. 71 wt% is reported for the first time and demonstrated in a pilot-scale unit (feeding rate of 11.3 kg h−1) using a granular Na2CO3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (loading of 650 g) to produce a high-grade bio-oil at a fast pyrolysis temperature of 475 ± 5 °C (pre-screened using a pyroprobe) and a catalytic upgrading temperature of 500 °C. Besides, &gt; 99 wt% minerals in the paper sludge could be recovered, including paper fillers such as CaCO3 (major) and talc. The bio-oil obtained at a carbon yield of 21 C.% has a low oxygen content of 3.2 wt%, a low total acidity number of 5.2 mg KOH g−1, low H2O content of 0.7 wt%, and a high higher heating value of 40.9 MJ kg−1. It consists of value-added bio-based chemicals such as paraffins, olefins, and low molecular weight aromatics. The results demonstrate that the use of paper sludge to recover minerals and to obtain fuels and chemicals using ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis is technically feasible at a pilot plant scale, which will be of importance for the development of future bio-based economy. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Developing cleaner and affordable alternatives to the sole reliance on fossil fuels has intensified efforts to improve the thermochemical conversion property of the second-generation lignocellulosic biomass. This study aimed to explore the effects of the two torrefaction temperatures (200 and 300 °C), the two reaction atmospheres (N2/O2 and CO2/O2), and the three heating rates (5, 10, and 15 °C/min) on the combustion regime of water hyacinth (WH). Decomposition behaviors, reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanisms, evolved emissions and functional groups, and fuel microstructure properties were quantified. The deoxygenation and dehydration reactions acted as the main drivers of the torrefaction process, with the peak degree of deoxygenation of 86.21% for WH torrefied at 300 °C (WH300). WH300 significantly reduced the quantity of oxygen-containing functional groups and altered the fuel microstructure properties. The order of the decomposition rates of the pseudo-components were hemicellulose &gt; cellulose &gt; lignin for both WH and WH torrefied at 200 °C (WH200) and cellulose &gt; lignin &gt; hemicellulose for WH300. The average activation energy fell from 197.71 to 195.71 kJ/mol for WH, 287.90 to 195.97 kJ/mol for WH200, and 226.92 to 184.94 kJ/mol for WH300 when the atmosphere changed from N2/O2 to CO2/O2. The heating rate exerted a stronger control on their combustion behaviors than did the reaction atmosphere. CO2, NO, and NO2 emissions dropped by 46.0, 53.1, and 65.9% for WH200 and 29.6, 42.8, and 62.5% for WH300, respectively, when compared to WH. 473.7 °C, 5 °C/min, and the CO2/O2 atmosphere were the optimal settings for the maximized combustion efficiency. 717.1 °C was determined as the optimal setting for the minimized combustion emissions. Our study can yield new insights into the large-scale and cleaner combustion of the torrefied water hyacinth. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Porous organic polymers (POPs) represent an emerging class of porous organic materials which mainly comprise organic building blocks that are interconnected via strong covalent bonds, thereby offering highly cross-linked frameworks with rigid structures and specific void spaces for accommodating guest molecules. In the past few years, POPs have garnered colossal research interest as nanoreactors for heterogeneous catalysis (thermal, photochemical, electrochemical, etc.) because of their intriguing characteristic features, such as high thermal and chemical stabilities, adjustable chemical functionalities, large surface areas, and tunable pore size distributions. This feature article provides an overview of existing research relating to diverse POP synthetic approaches (COFs, CTFs, and some amorphous POPs), the possible modification of the functionality of POPs, and their exciting application as next-generation nanoreactors. These POPs are extremely interesting, as they offer the potential for either metal-free or metalated polymer catalysts allowing photocatalytic CO2 reduction to solar-fuel, biofuel upgrades, the conversion of waste cooking oil to bio-oil, and clean H2 production from water, addressing many scientific and technological challenges and providing new opportunities for various specific topics in catalysis. Finally, we emphasize that the integration of various synthetic approaches and the application of POPs as nanoreactors will provide opportunities in the near future for the precision synthesis of functional materials with significant impact in both basic and applied research areas.

AB  - Bio-oils are multicomponent heterogeneous systems with different origins and prehistory, which implies that they have a complex rheological and thermophysical behavior. The high viscosity of bio-oils is the reason for their special treatment, including hydrogenation, which affects the structure, properties, and, accordingly, the possibility of using the resulting products as liquid fuels. This makes it important to understand the relationship between the structural features of bio-oils and their rheology. In this study, the rheological behavior of four samples of original and hydrogenated bio-oils was studied in a wide temperature range from -30 °C to 70 °C. Bio-oil samples exhibited viscoelasticity and were characterized by the presence of a yield stress, the value of which depended on the content of the dispersed phase in the bio-oil and the type of continuous medium. From a morphological point of view, the original bio-oils represented water-in-oil emulsions, while the hydrogenated samples were oil-in-water ones. According to differential scanning calorimetry data, bio-oils tended to undergo significant supercooling and did not exhibit phase transitions when cooled to at least -50 °C. Arrhenius activation energies can be used to express the tendency of bio-oils to undergo viscosity increase and structure formation (leading to the appearance of a yield stress) with varying the temperature. It was shown that hydrogenated bio-oils have a lower yield stress and apparent viscosity measured at high shear stresses. The complex rheological behavior of bio-oils makes it incorrect to characterize them by a single viscosity value, since it depends not only on the phase composition of the bio-oil, but also on the measuring conditions, which must be tailored individually, taking into account future bio-oil applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The effect of K2CO3 on the fast co-pyrolysis of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and wood powder (WP) was studied. The pyrolysis characteristics were studied using TGA and the pyrolysis experiments were carried out on a fixed bed reactor. The results showed that after the addition of K2CO3, the solid residues increased, and the weight loss of the sample decreased. The activation energy and the pre-exponential factor were determined by kinetic methods, and the addition of WP was found to decrease the activation energy of the first and second stages of the PVC pyrolysis. When K2CO3 was added, the first stage activation energy of the mixture increased and the second stage activation energy decreased. The analysis of the solid product showed that K2CO3 could effectively absorb the HCl produced by pyrolysis. The results of fixed-bed experiments showed that K2CO3 could inhibit the generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and promoted the generation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which could be attributed to the catalytic action of alkali metals and the enhancement of the pyrolysis behavior by CO2 release. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) is considered as one of the hazardous wastes because improper disposal of WCO can cause significant environmental problems such as blockages of drains and sewers as well as water or soil pollution. In this review, the physical and chemical properties of WCO are evaluated along with its regulations and policies in different countries to promote WCO refined biofuels. Blended WCO can be an auxiliary fuel for municipal solid waste incinerators while the heat produced is able to form superheated steam and subsequently generate electricity via combined heat and power system. Also, WCO contains high ratio of hydrogen atoms compared to carbon and oxygen atoms, making it able to be catalytically cracked, synthesizing hydrogen gas. WCO-based biodiesel has been traditionally produced by transesterification in order to substitute petroleum-based diesel which has non-degradability as well as non-renewable features. Hence, the potentials of hazardous WCO as a green alternative energy source for electricity generation, hydrogen gas as well as biofuels production (e.g. biodiesel, biogas, biojet fuel) are critically discussed due to its attractive psychochemical properties as well as its economic feasibility. Challenges of the WCO utilization as a source of energy are also reported while highlighting its future prospects. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We have prepared high purity Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) by solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method with the aid of lime juice extract. From powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra, it is observed that the ZnO NPs possess single phase, hexagonal wurzite structure with sharp intense peak at (1 0 1) plane, agrees with the planes of SAED pattern. Further, the crystallite size is found to be around 18 nm. UV–Vis analysis shows strong UV absorbance band at 381 nm and PL measurements reveals the presence of strong UV emission at 347 nm along with few weak visible emissions. Optical studies infer the existence of lower recombination rate of electron-hole pair, influence the photocatalytic activity of ZnO. From XPS measurements, presence of oxygen rich states on surface are also confirmed (O 1 s states). The degradation performance and reusability of four different dyes (methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), rhodamine B (RhB), Pararosaniline (PRA)) under UV and sunlight irradiations are carried out to illustrate the photo-catalytic activity in presence of a catalyst like ZnO NPs. Comparatively, about 98.8% of PRA and MB dyes are photodegraded at 90 and 75 min of sunlight irradiation, respectively. Among these two, PRA dye shows maximum degradation performance with shorter irradiation time along with good stability, which can be extend very well to minimize the pollution issues happening in society especially, industrial wastes. © 2021

AB  - Microalga-based fuels are promising solutions for replacing fossil fuels. This feedstock presents several advantages such as fast growth in a harsh environment and an ability to trap gases emitted from industries, thus reducing global warming effects. An efficient way to convert harvested microalgae into biofuels is hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which yields an intermediate product called biocrude. In this study, the elemental and molecular compositions of 15 different HTL biocrudes were determined by means of different techniques. Wild algae were cultivated in an industrial environment with plant emissions as a carbon source in fresh or seawater. It was notably observed that the culture medium had an influence on the biochemical composition and mineral matter content of algae. Thus, seawater algae were characterized by larger amounts of carbohydrates and mineral matter than freshwater ones, which also affected the oil yields and the light and heavy fractions of biocrudes. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The prospection of new degrading enzymes of the plant cell wall has been the subject of many studies and is fundamental for industries, due to the great biotechnological importance of achieving a more efficient depolymerization conversion from plant polysaccharides to fermentable sugars, which are useful not only for biofuel production but also for various bioproducts. Thus, we explored the shotgun metagenome data of a bacterial community (CB10) isolated from sugarcane bagasse and recovered three metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). The genomic distance analyses, along with phylogenetic analysis, revealed the presence of a putative novel Chitinophaga species, a Pandoraea nosoerga, and Labrys sp. isolate. The isolation process for each one of these bacterial lineages from the community was carried out in order to relate them with the MAGs. The recovered draft genomes have reasonable completeness (72.67–100%) and contamination (0.26–2.66%) considering the respective marker lineage for Chitinophaga (Bacteroidetes), Pandoraea (Burkholderiales), and Labrys (Rhizobiales). The in-vitro assay detected cellulolytic activity (endoglucanases) only for the isolate Chitinophaga, and its genome analysis revealed 319 CAZymes, of which 115 are classified as plant cell wall degrading enzymes, which can act in fractions of hemicellulose and pectin. Our study highlights the potential of this Chitinophaga isolate provides several plant-polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - One of the most important biofuels is cellulose ethanol which is a popular material for bioethanol production. The present cellulosic ethanol production is through the cellulolytic process and this involves the splitting of complex cellulose into simple sugars through the hydrolysis process of the lignocellulose pretreated with acids and enzymes after which the product is fermented and distilled. There are, however, some challenges due to the enzymatic and acid processes based on the fact that acid hydrolysis has the ability to corrode equipment and cause unwanted waste while the enzymatic hydrolysis process requires a longer time because enzymes are costly and limited. This means there is a need for innovations to minimize the problems associated with these two processes and this led to the application of solid catalysts as the green and effective catalyst to convert cellulose to ethanol. Solid catalysts are resistant to acid and base conditions, have a high surface area, and do not cause corrosion during the conversion of the cellulose due to their neutral pH. This review, therefore, includes the determination of the cellulose potential as feedstock to be used in ethanol production as well as the preparation and application of solid catalyst as the mechanism to convert cellulose into fuel and chemicals.

AB  - Due to its wide application, synthesizing silica through a cost-effective process becomes an attractive subject to be studied today. In this work, mesoporous silica (MS) was prepared from the highly available agricultural waste, rice husk ash (RHA), to be used as catalyst in the pyrolysis of α-cellulose. Silica was extracted from RHA through a reflux process in a strong base solution and arranged into a mesoporous structure by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). To find a condition that produces a mesoporous support with the highest surface area and catalytic activity, the mole ratios of CTAB:SiO2 used during the preparation of MS were varied; 0.05:1; 0.1:1; 0.2:1. Afterwards, all prepared MS were characterized using Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and Surface Area Analyzer (SAA). Through he surface area analysis, it was found that MS materials possessed surface area, pore diameter, and pore volume that range from 600–970 m2.g−1, 3.5–4.7 nm, 0.7–1 cm3.g−1, respectively. The highest surface area, with over 970.80 m2.g−1, was obtained in MS support prepared by using CTAB:SiO2 mole ratio of 0.1:1. SEM images showed a coral reef-like surface morphology for all MS. In the pyrolysis of α-cellulose evaluated by Py-GCMS, aside from producing biofuel compounds, the use of MS was able to generate two-fold furan production, which is considered as a valuable compound in many chemical syntheses. This result highlights the potential of MS prepared from RHA to be used as a catalysis support material that is more economical for biofuel and other chemical production. Copyright © 2021 by Authors

AB  - The works focus on maximizing the efficiency and reducing the wastage of reactant to make the possibility of upscaling in the bio-fuel production process for maximum yield conditions. Bio-oil derived from the Citrullus lanatus (Watermelon) for synthesizing methyl ester was used as a feedstock. The value of 1.13 mg KOH/g FFA content is recorded in the oil by employing the titration technique. Henceforth, transesterification using base catalyst reaction was allowed to transform watermelon seed oil into methyl ester. The experimental variables like methanol to oil molar ratio, KOH, and time remained for optimization based on the Taguchi technique. The outcome of the work was a 6:1 M ratio, 1 wt% KOH, 150 min and 55 °C are optimal experimental conditions for maximum conversion efficiency of 93.2%. Amid the four entities, the molar ratio was identified as the substantial influencing variable. The EN14214 standards were compared with characteristics of watermelon methyl ester, and the values obtained have fulfilled the requirements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lipid fraction from Monoraphidium sp. to obtain aromatic compounds by catalytic flash pyrolysis using HZSM-5 was studied in this work. Oil extraction has been performed by Schmid-Bondzynski-Ratzlaff, flash pyrolysis was carried out at 500 °C in an analytical micropyrolyzer and the pyrolysis vapors were transported to a fixed catalytic bed heated to 300 °C. According to the results, in the pyrolysis of the lipid extract, most of the renewable aliphatic hydrocarbons obtained were from the range of fuels such as gasoline and kerosene. A formation of about 11% of aromatic compounds was also obtained by non-catalytic pyrolysis due to the large amount of unsaturated fatty acids present in this lipid fraction (60.13%). The HZSM-5 presented high deoxygenation activity, producing 73% of monoaromatics and 12% of hydrocarbons in C4–C11 range. The products identified are useful in different segments of the chemical industry, and can also be used as aromatics additives in advanced fuels. © 2021

AB  - Adequate water-removal techniques are requisite to remain superior biofuel quality. The effects of vibrating types and operating time on the water-removal efficiency of molecular sieves were experimentally studied. Molecular sieves of 3 Å pore size own excellent hydrophilic characteristics and hardly absorb molecules other than water. Molecular sieves of 3 Å accompanied by two different vibrating types, rotary shaking and electromagnetic stirring, were used to remove initial water from the reactant mixture of feedstock oil in order to prevent excessive growth or breeding of microorganisms in the biofuel product. The physical structure of about 66% molecular sieves was significantly damaged due to shattered collision between the magnetic bar and molecular sieves during electromagnetic stirring for 1 h. The molecular sieves vibrated by the rotary shaker appeared to have relatively higher water-removal efficiency than those by the electromagnetic stirrer and by keeping the reactant mixture motionless by 6 and 5 wt.%, respectively. The structure of the molecular sieves vibrated by an electromagnetic stirrer and thereafter being dehydrated appeared much more irregular and damaged, and the weight loss accounted for as high as 19 wt.%. In contrast, the structure of the molecular sieves vibrated by a rotary shaker almost remained original ball-shaped, and the weight loss was much less after regenerative treatment for those molecular sieves. As a consequence, the water-removal process using molecular sieves vibrated by the rotary shaker is considered a competitive method during the biofuel production reaction to achieve a superior quality of biofuels. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) represents a crucial cathodic process of different fuel cells. The development of highly active and stable noble metal-free ORR electrocatalysts remains as one of major challenges. Herein, we report cobalt/nitrogen co-doped porous carbon materials (Co-N-C) originated from well-designed bimetal-organic frameworks (Zn100-xCox-ZIF) as efficient ORR electrocatalysts in both pH-neutral and alkaline solutions. The compositional and structural features, and the corresponding ORR activity can be tailored by tuning the Zn/Co ratio in the precursor. Remarkable features of large surface-area and suitable graphitization degree and well-dispersed Co-N-C moieties, enable a high catalytic efficiency. The optimized electrocatalyst registers considerable ORR performance with a high half-wave potential of 0.65 V vs RHE and a saturated current density of 5.30 mA cm−2 close to the value of the commercial Pt/C in 0.1 M pH 7.0 PBS, along with considerable operational stability and tolerance to glucose. A preliminary one-compartment hybrid glucose/O2 enzymatic biofuel cell, consisting of the Co-N-C-10 abiotic cathode and a glucose oxidizing bioanode, is constructed and tested. Furthermore, Co-N-C presents reasonable ORR electrocatalytic activity and operational stability in alkaline condition. © 2021

AB  - The production of biodiesel from waste activated sludge by the in-situ transesterification of its lipid content is studied in this work, comparing both basic and acidic catalytic routes. The acid mechanism is chosen as the optimum one, considering that the high percentage of free fatty acids strongly limits the yields obtained by the basic route, due to the saponification competence. Different pre-treatments are proposed (sonication, microwaves, sieving) to enhance the extraction rate, identified as the limiting step of the process. Sludge drying requirements are also analysed, concluding that water contents below 20% (weight base) does not lead to significant decreases in the transesterification activity. The acidic reaction is also chosen once the quality of the final mixture as alternative biofuel is analysed. Almost all the biodiesel properties (higher heat value, iodine number, kinematic viscosity, density, and long-chain saturated factor and cetane number) are in the optimum ranges proposed by the international normative, concluding that pretreatments do not damage the final product. Optimum results were obtained applying microwaves, with a final yield of 46.7% of FAMEs, which is a clear improvement on the previous literature of biodiesel obtaining from sewage sludge. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The demand for affordable energy will continue to increase. On the other side, the utilization of fossil fuels is causing drastic changes to our climate forcing us to search for more sustainable sources of energy. Lignocellulosic biomass waste from palm oil industry in Malaysia is one of the most abundant and economically attractive sources of renewable energy. This can be utilized as the raw material for solid biofuel, i.e., Bio-Coke. Some efforts have been made to improve the quality of Bio-Coke in recent years. This study aims to determine the influence of biological pretreatment of oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) on its subsequent Bio-Coke characteristics. The results show after pretreatment, the fiber structure of EFB could be seen clearly and a looser connection between single fibers is observed. The pretreatment leads to the biologically pretreated Bio-Coke having higher apparent density and longer combustion duration than the Bio-Coke without pretreatment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recently, the influence behavior of new pollutants in the environment has been widely concerned. However, the effect of antidepressants widely detected in excess sludge (ES) on biohydrogen production from anaerobic dark fermentation has never been explored. To fill this gap, fluoxetine (FLX), a typical antidepressant, was selected to evaluate its effect on ES mesophilic anaerobic dark biohydrogen fermentation. The results showed that FLX reduced biohydrogen production even at low content (0.1 mg/Kg). The biohydrogen yield was only 12.8 mL/g in the 1.8 mg/Kg (based on total suspended solids) FLX group, decreased by about 34.7%, compared with the control group (without FLX). Further mechanism investigation implied that high levels (more than 0.6 mg/Kg) of FLX reduced every step associated with the biohydrogen production. FLX reduced the concentration of ammonia nitrogen and phosphate in fermentation broth. FLX also had a significant negative effect on enzyme activity in ES dark fermentation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrogen (H2) and bio-oil production from renewable sources are promising technologies in the energy sector. Particularly, the use of microalgae as a biomass source in the catalytic pyrolysis process in a hydrogen atmosphere is an encouraging approach in the production of high-quality bio-oil. This study combines two forms of harnessing renewable energy: (1) production of H2 through alkaline electrolysis with sunlight as the energy source, and (2) the production of bio-oil through catalytic hydropyrolysis of microalgae using solar energy as a thermal source in biomass degradation. The effects of catalyst (hydrotalcite precursor) percentage (C) and reaction time (t) on the product distribution and bio-oil content are analyzed. An average bio-oil yield of 45.77% is achieved using ex situ catalytic solar hydropyrolysis, which reaches up to 48.83% under optimal experimental conditions. The hydrogen atmosphere contributes to reducing oxygenated compounds and using a catalyst reduces nitrogenous compounds and raises the hydrocarbon level in the liquid fraction. The bio-oil composition is found to reach 37% of hydrocarbons. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to its capability to produce negative CO2 emissions, bioenergy in combination with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has been identified as a key technology to limit global warming and to support the energy transition in pursue of the climate targets of this century. Among different bioenergy applications, advanced liquid biofuels produced through the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of waste biomass have gained interest as promising drop-in alternatives to fossil fuels. However, there is lack of studies in literature that evaluate the potential of HTL as negative emission technology in the context of BECCS and present detailed process design of such an implementation for different types of biomass. In this paper, we perform carbon capture modeling based on state-of-art experimental data on HTL of waste lignocellulosic and urban biomasses by means of physical absorption via the Selexol™ process. The process model is utilized for developing a techno-economic analysis that highlights key parameters to optimize CO2 capture cost efficiency. The results indicate that the purity of the CO2 product fulfils the requirements for geological storage in all cases studied, and is on-spec for pipeline transportation when the composition of C2+ hydrocarbons and H2S in the HTL gas are kept below 4 and 1 mol % respectively, or by the implementation of two absorption steps. For the standard process evaluated, the estimated cost of the captured CO2 is between 40 and 53 EUR/tonne, which is in the range of the carbon price expected within this decade in the EU emission trading system, given the announced cap reductions until 2030 and the targets set by the European Green Deal. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Wastewater containg proteinaceous ossein effluents are problematic to be treated. We studied the possibility to treat ossein effluents with the marine cyanobacterium strain Cylindrospermum stagnale. After optimizing the culture conditions of the bacterium, three different types of ossein effluents were tested: dicalcium phosphate (DCP), high total dissolved solids (HTDS) and low total dissolved (LTDS). The effluents were diluted with sea water at the following ratios 1:1, 2:1 and 3:2. The optimum operating conditions were at 3000 lux light intensity and 37 °C temperature. The highest degradation of ossein effluens by C. stagnale was attained for a dilution ratio of 1:1. However, less diluted ossein effluents reduced the growth of C. stagnale drastically. The degradation was shown by measuring the chlorophyll a content and the dry weight of bacterial cells during a seven-day incubation period degradation. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis verified the degradation showing the presence of the degradation products of ossein (i.e. calcium carbonate and calcite) in the culture medium. Lipid composition in fatty acids appeared to be suitable for biofuel production. The results showed that the marine cyanobacterium C. stagnale can be used to treat ossein effluents, and at the same time, to produce biofuel in a sustainable way. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, seaweed char-based catalyst was used for pyrolysis of waste clay oil to obtain high-grade biofuels. First, the biochar was activated at different temperatures of 600, 700, and 800 °C (Y600, Y700, and Y800, respectively). The specific surface area of seaweed char prepared by activation at 800 °C reached the maximum value (1227.74 m2/g), which was a good catalyst carrier. Then modified by Cu loading. Results showed that the seaweed carbon-based catalyst has a good decarboxylation effect. The obtained liquid product under catalytic pyrolysis showed the maximum heating value of 48402 kJ/kg by using 15% Cu/Y800 as a catalyst at feed/catalyst ratio of 10:1; with the highest hydrocarbon content, the content of long-chain hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons being 45.95% and 41.45%, respectively. The decarboxylation effect of Cu-modified seaweed char was obvious, and the copper particles distributed on the seaweed char form active sites, which effectively reformed the pyrolysis volatiles and promotes the production of hydrocarbons, especially aromatic hydrocarbons Therefore, the modified seaweed char-based catalyst has a certain aromatization effect. At the same time, the hydrogen content in the gas-phase product decreased significantly, which may be due to the hydrogenation reaction under the action of catalysis. © 2021

AB  - Inorganic zeolite/geopolymer composite (Z/GP) was synthesized by controlled zeolitization of synthetic geopolymer from kaolinite and diatomite to be used as a potential catalyst in the transesterification of commercial spent cooking oil (SCO). The Z/GP composite demonstrates promising microstructural properties (106 m2/g surface area and 4.2 nm average pore diameter) and chemical structural enrich in OH and Na+ ions as active basic and catalytic centers. The Z/GP composite as catalyst was applied in the transesterification of SCO according to suggested experiment conditions from statistical design which was built based on the Response Surface Methodology. The measured biodiesel yield from SCO over Z/GP catalyst is 98.1% at experimental conditions of 40 °C as temperature, 90 min as time, 12:1 as methanol/SCO ratio, and 3.25 wt, % as Z/GP loading value. The theoretical optimization function of the statistical design suggested potential enhancement for the performance of the reaction to achieve a yield of 99% by adjusting the values of the studied factors at 54.9 °C, 81.9 min, at 12:1, and 3.48 wt, % for the temperature, time, methanol/SCO ratio, and Z/GP loading. The physical properties of the produced SCO-based biodiesel over Z/GP demonstrate the suitability of the product to be used as biofuels considering the criteria to international standards. The kinetic properties of the transesterification reactions of SCO over Z/GP catalyst follow the Pseudo-First order kinetic assumption and occurred with low activation energy. Finally, the synthetic Z/GP as a solid basic catalyst is of significant reusability and reused five times with remarkable biodiesel yields. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed at analyzing the feasibility of converting diverse types of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) into fuel pellets for low-emission bioenergy producing systems. Sources of SMS for pelletization included paddy straw and achiote capsule shell from Pleurotus ostreatus, eucalyptus sawdust and grassy straw from Lentinula edodes, and compost with either peat or soil as a casing layer from Agaricus subrufescens. The pilot-scale manufacturing of fuel pellets consisted of compacting the feedstocks in an automatic pelletizer machine at 200 MPa and 125 °C. Pellets from SMS, irrespective of source, met the international standards for solid biofuels, except for ash content. However, due to moderate sulfur content (0.05%), they tended to low slagging (S &lt; 0.60) and intermediate fouling (0.60 ≤ F ≤ 40.00) on a boiler's heating surface. Because of the significant ash content of 29.10–31.80%, these products resisted oxidation more at the onset of combustion, burned themselves out gradually and conducted 2.70–2.90 W g−1 heat at around 300 °C. Pellets of SMS from A. subrufescens grown on compost with soil casing, produced less heat (4.25 W g−1) than reference pellets from pinewood sawdust (5.10 W g−1), but emitted less CO2 (7.50 ppb vs 15.10 ppb), NOx (130.10 ppt vs 147.90 ppt), SO2 (3.15 ppt vs 16.70 ppt), and volatile organic compounds (17.65 mg m−3 vs 27.20 mg m−3). Pelletization of SMSs valorized these agro-food residues via waste-to-energy pathways towards a circular economy. SMS from A. subrufescens grown on compost with soil casing had the best properties for high-performance pelletization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are known as renewable, potential, and sustainable feedstocks for biofuel production. The present work investigated the efficient valorization of green microalgae Chlorella sp. to produce sugars and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) using thermochemical conversion with a metal-salt (ferric sulfate) as catalyst using a statistical approach and two-step conversion. A statistical approach with a Box–Behnken design was introduced to optimize the conversion for producing sugars. As a result of optimization, 86.46% sugar yield (68.32% glucose yield) was achieved under the condition of 5% biomass and 0.6 g-catalyst/g-biomass at 155 °C and 40 min. Two-step thermochemical conversion was introduced to produce 5-HMF from microalgae. In the first step, sugars were produced from the above optimum condition; in the second step, sugar hydrolysates were converted into 5-HMF by thermochemical conversion without an additional catalyst. In two-step conversion, the maximum 5-HMF yield (37.23%) was achieved at 170 °C and 60 min from the sugar hydrolysate of microalgae obtained from the first-step thermochemical conversion with ferric sulfate. In conclusion, the microalgae as biomass and ferric sulfate as catalyst have availability and the potential to produce biosugars and platform chemicals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuels contribute environment-friendly, renewable energy, minimizing dependence on fossil energy. The pretreatment of biomass is a practical step that accelerates and facilitates the hydrolysis of complex materials. This work aimed to screen, select, and study cocktail formulations for biomass hydrolysis, where the enzymes were provided both from a commercial source (Trichoderma reesei, Novozymes®) and through the cultivation of Aspergillus brasiliensis and Aspergillus tamarii Kita. Experimental mixture designs were used to optimize the enzymatic conversion of substrates into simple sugars. A crude extract rich in amylase (AAB) had a significant favorable influence on cornmeal hydrolysis by maximizing the yield of reducing sugars (RS) (173 μmol mL–1). Celluclast™, rich in cellulase, significantly affected the hydrolysis of banana peel, maximizing the RS yield (175 μmol mL–1). Variable degrees of enzyme synergism were evident from statistical analysis of the biomass hydrolysis. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - This study has demonstrated, for the first time, a simple, fast and flexible microwave processing method for the simultaneous preparation of bio-products (bio-oil, bio-gas and biochar) using a methodology that avoids any form of catalyst or chemical activation. The dielectric properties of biomass and physicochemical characterisation such as TGA, elemental and proximate analysis, XRD, SEM/EDX and textural properties, showed that 8 kJ g−1 of microwave energy can produce superior biochars for applications in CO2 capture. The maximum CO2 uptake capacity for biochar produced was 2.5 mmol g−1 and 2.0 mmol g−1 at 0 and 25 °C and 1 bar, which and also exhibited high gas selectivity compared with N2, fast kinetics of adsorption (&lt;10 min) and desirable reusability (&gt;95%) after 20 cycles. GC-MS analysis of generated bio-oil products revealed that higher microwave energies (&gt;8 kJ g−1) significantly enhanced the amount of bio-oil produced (39%) and specifically the formation of levoglucosan, furfural and phenolics compounds, and bio-gas analysis identified trace levels of H2 and CH4. The results from this study confirm a green, inexpensive and efficient approach for biomass valorisation which can easily be embedded within bio-refinery process, and also demonstrates the potential of biochars for post-combustion CO2 uptake. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Promising bifunctional catalyst systems composed of platinum and polyoxometalates (POMs) were applied successfully for the selective catalytic hydrogenation of 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) to 2-hexanol under mild conditions. Pt(acac)2 was found to be the most active Pt precursor for the ring opening of DMF, and the Keggin-type POM K3[PW12O40] was identified as the most promoting acidic support for 2-hexanol formation at 80 °C and 10 bar H2 pressure using n-decane as a carrier liquid. It was revealed that modifications in the synthetic procedure of the Pt/K3[PW12O40] catalytic system allowed its catalytic performance to be enhanced. Thus, a higher yield of 2-hexanol (72.5%) was achieved compared to that (49%) obtained using a commercial Pt/C catalyst with the same Pt loading. The Wells–Dawson-type POM containing catalyst Pt/K6[α-P2W18O62] was found to be selective for 2-hexanon formation (56.4% yield) under identical reaction conditions. Furthermore, furan and 2-methylfuran were also selectively hydrogenated to 1-butanol (59.7% yield) and 1/2-pentanol (44.3% yield), respectively, under the applied reaction conditions. Moreover, using analytical tools like N2-physisorption, NH3-TPD, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), CO chemisorption, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), revealed that the higher total acid site density of the K3[PW12O40] enhances C=O hydrogenation and overcomes the rate-limiting step of 2-hexanone hydrogenation to 2-hexanol. This demonstrates the high performance of the bi-functional catalyst system Pt/K3[PW12O40] towards ring opening of various furans and the very high selectivity towards alcohol formation. This approach opens new interesting valorization pathways for several furanic compounds with respect to sustainable alcohol formation. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The design of the morphology-controlled synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal oxides nanomaterials is a key for electrochemical oxidation of glucose. Herein, a general preparation method is adopted to develop a variety of transition metal oxides nanosheets, including cobalt oxide nanosheets (Co3O4 NS), nickel oxide nanosheets (NiO NS), copper oxide nanosheets (CuO NS), and iron oxide nanosheets (Fe3O4 NS) through a chemical reduction method followed by a hydrothermal strategy. The surface morphological characterization is performed by using transmission electron microscopic (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM), and atomic force microscopic (AFM) measurements, revealed the two-dimensional nanosheets-like metal oxides formed. The as-developed transition metal oxide nanosheets are employed as electrocatalysts for the improved oxidation of glucose under alkaline electrolyte. The NiO nanosheets delivers best catalytic current density of ~3.1 mA cm−2 which is over- ~1.7- and ~2.6- times higher with a less positive potential, respectively in comparison to Co3O4 nanosheets and CuO nanosheets based electrodes. The morphological engineered two-dimensional nanosheets exhibit high electrochemical active sites, fast electron transfer kinetics, etc. towards the glucose oxidation reaction (GOR). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study addresses the significant utility of Used Palm oil Methyl Ester (UPOME) and enhancing the capabilities by adding butyl ferulate. This phenolic antioxidant ester was synthesized using Rhizopus nevius lipase immobilised onto cuttlebone. The butyl ferulate synthesis was monitored in RP-HPLC and confirmed via GC-MS. Concurrently, UPOME was prepared using KOH as the catalyst from the used palm oil. The UPOME was fortified with ferulic acid and butyl ferulate, separately at various concentrations and subjected to thermal oxidation at 110 °C. Biodiesel prepared were estimated for oxidative stability by pattern variations deciphered from the excitation-emission matrix profile. Similarly, the induction period (IP) of the prepared biodiesels was analysed in Rancimate. The addition of the butyl ferulate at 600 ppm in UPOME was able to reduce 80% of the hydroperoxide formation whereas the free ferulic acid showed Stokes shift at the same condition and concentration. Comparatively, 3.5 fold escalation in IP was observed in UPOME with 1000 ppm butyl ferulate than the free ferulic acid. Emission characteristics depicted a significant reduction in NOx (4.7%), CO (27.8%), CO2 (8.3%) and Unburned Hydrocarbons (5.7%) when fuelled B20 with 1000 ppm BF in Compression Ignition engine. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In today's era, we need to replace chemical or physical processes of nanoparticle synthesis with biosynthesis processes to avoid environmental damage. These bioderived nanoparticles can help in addressing the problems of wastewater treatment and biofuels production. This review gives an insight into solving multiple problems using a nano-biorefinery approach in conjugation with wastewater treatment. The major advantage of using a bio-derivative method in nanoparticle synthesis is its low toxicity towards the environment. The current review discusses the development of nanoscience and its biogenic importance. It covers the usage of microalgae for (A) Nanoparticle's biosynthesis (B) Mechanism of nanoparticle biosynthesis (C) Nanoparticles in bio-refinery processes (D) Wastewater treatment with microalgae and bio-derived nanoparticles (E) A hypothetical mechanistic approach, which utilizes the photothermal effect of metallic nanoparticles to extract lipids from the cells without cell damage. The term “cell milking” has been around for quite some time, and the hypothesis discussed in the present study can help in this context. The current hypothesized process can pave ways for futuristic endeavors to conjugate nanoparticles and microalgae for viable and commercial production of biofuel, nanoparticles, and many other molecules. © 2021

AB  - The need for producing renewable fuels from biomass has increased due to depleting fossil resources and environmental concerns. However, the low fraction of biomass carbon converted to product is an undeniable drawback for most current biofuel productions from fermentation due to undecomposed lignin in biomass composition and carbon loss as CO2. In this work, two main production routes of the MixAlco® process, the ketonization route (KR) and esterification route (ER) are evaluated for the mixed alcohol production by brown algae, a third-generation biomass without lignin. A novel fermentation process using syntrophic bacteria consortia (SBC) is developed to produce acetic acid from waste gas produced by KR and ER process. The paper investigates the integrated flowsheet for these alternative routes, using techno-economic and life cycle analysis to compare the minimum selling price and environmental impacts. From TEA, we find that the overall costs for KR and ER are lower than the SBC processes. The cost of ketonization routes is lower than esterification routes. The capital cost and operating cost for the ER+SBC process are the highest. Raw materials and utilities are the two major costs for all the processing routes examined. The MSP for the ER+SBC process is the lowest out of all four routes. ER process performs the best in terms of environmental impacts except in water depletion compared with other processes, while the KR process performs the worst regarding the environmental metrics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Direct production of biodiesel by both esterification and transesterification of renewable oils with acid value (AV) of 9.6–28.9 mg KOH/g using calcined blast furnace dust is studied. Blast furnace dust calcined at 600–700 °C obviously promotes efficient biodiesel production because of the crystal form transformation from lead sulfate particles in dust into active lead oxide, lead sulfide, and lead particles. It is found for the first time that lead oxide, lead sulfide and lead particles can resist saponification from fatty acids to catalyze raw renewable oils to biodiesel with catalytic activity order as follows: lead oxide > lead > lead sulfide > lead sulfate. Biodiesel production process is optimized according to an orthogonal design with biodiesel yield of 92 wt% obtained at AV of 9.6 mg KOH/g (82 wt% after 5 cycles). Biodiesel yield of 84 wt% is achieved at AV of 28.9 mg KOH/g with acidity of 0.18 mmol/g. Calcined blast furnace dust presents potential applications in the production of biodiesel from renewable oils with high AVs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The development of non–noble metal–based catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) upgrading of biomass pyrolysis oils is crucial for realizing the cost-effective biofuel production. In this paper, we report on the enhanced HDO activity of the rhenium-promoted nickel catalysts (Ni-Re) for the HDO of a pyrolysis oil model compound, guaiacol. The catalyst screening studies revealed that the Ni-Re displayed a considerably higher HDO activity than other monometallic (Ni, Re, Cu, Co) and bimetallic catalysts (Cu-Re, Co-Re), highlighting its unique catalytic property. In order to optimize the catalytic activity and reveal the structure–activity relationship of the Ni-Re catalysts, the effects of the Ni/Re ratio and type of support (SiO2, TiO2, and ZrO2) on the catalyst structure and HDO activity were investigated in detail. The results showed that the addition of rhenium to nickel altered both geometric and electronic structures of nickel significantly. The Ni-Re/SiO2 catalyst with a Ni/Re ratio of 0.315 achieved ~95% yield of the desired deoxygenation product, cyclohexane, at 523 K and 30 bar-H2 after 5 hours. Novelty Statement: The upgrading of biomass pyrolysis oils to hydrocarbon fuels oftentimes requires the use of noble metal catalysts and harsh reaction conditions (e.g., high H2 pressure), all of which greatly increase the process cost. In this work, a highly active and nonprecious metal–based catalyst, bimetallic Ni-Re/SiO2, is developed for the cost-effective upgrading of biomass-derived phenols to deoxygenated hydrocarbon fuels at low temperature and low pressure. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Digestate is a nutrient-rich substance produced by anaerobic digestion that contains organic, inorganic, and biological matter. The European Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC) provides regulations regarding the wider implementation of the digestate. Owing to a significant amount of organic matter in the digestate, it can be utilised as a solid biofuel, soil amendment substance, or substrate for activated carbon production. However, the solid by-products of the anaerobic digestion of the municipal solid waste wet fraction cannot be used for such applications because it is still considered a waste. Hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) was investigated as a pre-treatment method for the digestate obtained by anaerobic digestion of the municipal solid waste wet fraction. HTC was carried out at temperatures of 180, 200 and 230 °C and residence times of 30, 60 and 120 min. The value of pressure was determined based on water temperature and partial pressure of the gaseous by-products. The HTC process resulted in changes in the physical and chemical properties of the hydrochars compared to those of the raw materials. A temperature of 200 °C and residence time of 60 min during HTC were optimal for energy consumption; this hydrochar exhibited the best combustion parameters and physical properties (specific surface area). © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - This work reported the one-pot synthesis of the promising, cheap and green heterogeneous nanocatalyst for biodiesel production. The halloysite nanotube (HNT) was impregnated with 40 wt% NaAlO2 (SA) and the assistance of ultrasonic helped to achieve a better and more stable modification. The resulting 0.4SA/HNTs-UI catalyst was applied in catalyzing the transesterification of palm oil with methanol, using a GA_BP neural network to train and predict the optimal values of reaction parameters. The test results proved the prediction accuracy of the model with R2 = 0.989. The catalyst possessed excellent performance, and the maximum biodiesel yield of 99.15% was achieved with the catalyst loaded amount of 8.82 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio of 16.79 and transesterification temperature of 65.12 °C. Besides, the physicochemical properties of the purified transesterification product were in accordance with the ASTM D 6751 standard of biodiesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is an effective conversion technology of microalgae biomass. In this study, the low-lipid microalgae-spirulina platensis was used as feedstock to investigate the performance of the biochar-based catalysts on HTL. The by-product of spirulina platensis HTL-solid residue was collected and activated to obtain the biochar (BC). Then, the BC was used as the carrier to support Co, Ni and their oxides CoOx and NiO to form Co/BC, Ni/BC, CoOx/BC, NiO/BC catalysts. The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the HTL parameters and investigate the effect of biochar-based catalysts on HTL. The results showed that the maximum yield of bio-oil catalyzed by BC was 35.80 wt% with 304 °C, 34.7 min, and 0.32 g catalyst loading. BC catalyst displayed an improvement of bio-oil yield up to 4.00 wt% at low temperatures (260–280 °C). Ni/BC was the most favorable catalyst for bio-oil production, reaching a maximum value of 36.57 wt% at 280 °C, 35.0 min, and 0.15 g catalyst loading, which increased by 6.40 wt% compared with the non catalytic case. The characterization of bio-oil showed that CoOx/BC and NiO/BC could raise the hydrocarbon content, H/C value, and heat value, while decrease O/C value. Ni/BC had an excellent denitrification effect on bio-oil, the N content was reduced by nearly 2.00 wt% compared with the non catalytic case. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of biomass into biocrude is attractive but the biocrude themselves are poor fuels, which need to be upgraded for further utilization. Compared with the traditional catalytic upgradation process, a non-catalytic method for biocrude upgrading in the aqueous waste (HTL-AW) derived from HTL of cornstalk was proposed. Optimal reaction conditions of upgradation process were obtained at 356 °C (temperature), 37 min (reaction time) and 19 mL/g (HTL-AW/biocrude) based on the response surface methodology. The biocrude was effectively upgraded in the HTL-AW and a high hydrogen to carbon effective (H/Ceff) ratio of 1.07 with a higher heating value of 36.94 MJ/kg was observed. The energy recovery of ∼80% from biocrude to upgraded biocrude was feasible. GC–MS analysis showed that the contents of phenols and ketones were decreased from 65.61% to 48.38% and 22.39%–16.78%, respectively, while the contents of nitrogen-containing compounds n-hexadecanoic acid were increased from 2.25% to 10.15% and 9.56%–22.23%, respectively. The high H/Ceff was attributed to the promoted deoxygenation by alkali and alkaline earth metals as well as H+ enriched in the HTL-AW. This study demonstrates the feasibility of improving the H/Ceff of biocrude in the HTL-AW under a relatively mild reaction condition. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), accessible from various feedstocks, represents an important renewable platform-chemical, precursor for valuable biofuels and bio-based chemicals. In this work, the continuous hydrogenation of an aqueous solution of HMF to give strategic monomers, 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) and 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BHMTHF) was investigated in a continuous flow reactor adopting a commercial Ru/C (5 wt%) as catalyst. The influence of the main process variables on products yield and selectivity was studied and optimized. The highest BHMF and BHMTHF yields of 87.9 and 93.7 mol%, respectively, were achieved by tuning the catalyst contact time, keeping all other variables constant (temperature, pressure, hydrogen flow rate, initial HMF concentration). Intraparticle diffusion limitation for hydrogen and HMF was shown to occur at some of the tested conditions by performing the HMF hydrogenation with different catalyst particle sizes, confirmed by calculations. Constant catalyst activity was observed up to 6 h time-on-stream and then gradually reduced. Fresh and spent catalyst characterization showed no significant sintering and negligible leaching of ruthenium during time-on-stream. A decrease of the specific surface area was observed, mainly due to humin deposition which is likely the reason for catalyst deactivation. Catalyst performance could be restored to initial values by a thorough washing of the catalyst. © 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - Chemocatalytic upgrading of the greenhouse gas CO2 to valuable chemicals and biofuels has attracted broad attention in recent years. Among the reported approaches, N-formylation of CO2 with an amine is of great significance due to its versatility in the construction of N-containing linear and cyclic skeletons. Herein, a stable N-heterocyclic carbene-carboxyl adduct (NHC-CO2) was facilely prepared and could be used as a recyclable zwitterionic catalyst for efficient CO2 reductive upgrading via either N-formylation or further coupling with cyclization under mild conditions (25 °C, 1 atm CO2) using hydrosilane as a hydrogen source. More than 30 different alkyl and aromatic amines could be transformed into the corresponding formamides or benzimidazoles with remarkable yields (74%-98%). The electronic effect of the introduced substituent on NHC-CO2 was found to evidently affect the thermostability and nucleophilicity of the zwitterionic catalyst, which is directly correlated with its catalytic activity. Moreover, NHC-CO2 could supply CO2 by in situ decarboxylation at a specific temperature that is dependent on the introduced substituent type. Experimental and computational studies showed that the carboxyl species on NHC-CO2 was not only a nucleophilic center, but also a C1 source which rapidly captures or substitutes ambient CO2 during hydrosilylation. In addition, a simple and green conceptual process was designed for the product purification and catalyst recycling, with a good feasibility for small-scale production. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The rapid thermal cracking technology of biomass can convert biomass into bio-oil and is beneficial for industrial applications. Agricultural and forestry wastes are important parts of China's energy, and their high-grade utilization is useful to solve the problem of energy shortages and environmental pollution. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of nanocatalysts on converting biowastes for bio-oil has not been studied. Consequently, we examined the production of bio-oil by pyrolysis of Aesculus chinensis Bunge Seed (ACBS) using nanocatalysts (Fe2O3 and NiO catalysts) for the first time. The pyrolysis products of ACBS include 1-hydroxy-2-propanone (3.97%), acetic acid (5.42%), and furfural (0.66%). These chemical components can be recovered for use as chemical feedstock in the form of bio-oil, thus indicating the potential of ACBS as a feedstock to be converted by pyrolysis to produce value-added bio-oil. The Fe2O3 and NiO catalysts enhanced the pyrolysis process, which accelerated the precipitation of gaseous products. The pyrolysis rates of the samples gradually increased at DTGmax, effectively promoting the catalytic cracking of ACBS, which is beneficial to the development and utilization of ACBS to produce high valorization products. Combining ACBS and nanocatalysts can change the development direction of high valorization agricultural and forestry wastes in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper aims to discuss the influences of the doping of different types of nanoparticles into the bioethanol-diesel fuel blends on the combustion, performance, and emission aspects. In this viewpoint, the tests are performed at a constant engine speed of 2400 rpm under the varying engine loads from 3 to 12 Nm with the gaps of 3 Nm. Test engine is fuelled with conventional diesel fuel (DF), the binary form of 90% diesel fuel and %10 ethanol (DF90E10), and then separately 100 ppm aluminium oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles (DF90E10 + A100), and 100 ppm titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (DF90E10 + T100) into DF90E10 test fuel. In the results, DF90E10 increases brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by 6.25% and drops the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 2.1% in comparison to those of conventional DF. However, it is noticed that nanoparticles-doped DF90E10 test fuels are being pulled back the worsened performance results thanks to their higher surface to volume ratio, higher cetane number, higher calorific value, superior thermal properties, catalyst role of the accelerating chemical reactions in combustion proces, and high energy density of nanoparticles. Accordingly, BSFC is dropped by 2.25% and 1.26% whilst BTE is enhanced by 3.48% and 2.94% for DF90E10 + A100 and DF90E10 + T100 test fuels, respectively as compared to those of DF. Thanks to the excess oxygen content of ethanol and oxygen-donating catalyst role of nanoparticles, carbon monoxide (CO) is reduced by 14.29%, 25%, and 21.43%, and hydrocarbon (HC) is reduced by 21.32%, 30.15%, and 26.47% for DF90E10, DF90E10 + A100, and DF90E10 + T100, respectively as compared to those of conventional DF. NOx emission increases by 3.6% for DF90E10, and then nitrogen oxides (NOx) are reduced by 3.02%, and 1.57% for DF90E10 + A100 and DF90E10 + T100 due to the higher thermal conductivity value of nanoparticles and improving engine performance characteristics. On the other hand, the highest in-cylinder pressure (CPmax) and heat release rate (HRRmax) values, and longer ignition delay are generally noticed for the diesel-ethanol binary blend due to the lower cetane number, lower energy density and higher viscosity. In conclusion, this paper is proving that the doping of nanoparticles into the biofuels is presenting very satisfying results in pulling back the worsened engine characteristics arising from using diesel-biofuel binary blends. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The cellulose dissolution is an essential pretreatment process for the chemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels. Here, the dissolution of a 36-chain Iβ cellulose model with a hexagonal cross-section (M36HCS) in water is analyzed by Molecular Dynamics (MD) with CHARMM36/TIP3P (C36/TIP3P) force field using gradual heating at 25 MPa. Our simulations showed that the dissolution of M36HCS starts to occur between 560 K and 600 K, which agrees with experimental observations. In our system, conditions near the critical point of water reveal that translational and rotational entropies decrease, while the low hydration level increases vibrational entropy. This investigation theoretically shows that C36/TIP3P adequately reproduces the dissolution of M36HCS even in high-pressure water as corroborated in reactors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to reduce cost of biodiesel production there is need to use non-edible oil. Kusum feed oil is non-edible oil, low cost and substantial available for biodiesel production. To improve Kusum biodiesel performance and emission parameters there is need to analyze input variables in more comprehensive way. It is suitable to establish computational models to obtain optimal parameters. The main goal of the paper was to establish and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to determine the impact of blending, fuel injection timing, fuel injection pressure and engine load on brake thermal efficiency, unburnt hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen. It was found that the fuel injection pressure and engine load is the most influential factors on the brake thermal efficiency, unburnt hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen. The results could be useful for optimization of the Kusum biodiesel performance and emission parameters. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A compact kinetic reaction mechanism for simulating the oxidation of the unsaturated furanic fuels including furan, 2-methylfuran (MF2) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) is proposed in this work. The mechanism is developed by integrating the major reaction pathways for the three furanic fuel components into a toluene reference fuel reaction mechanism. The sub-mechanism describing the formation and growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons up to pyrene is also incorporated so that the prediction of soot formation is enabled. The major reaction pathways for these furanic fuels are derived from the detailed furanic fuel reaction mechanism in the literature via a systematic selection and extraction procedure. An advanced genetic algorithm is applied to automatically optimize the rate parameters for the major furanic fuel reaction pathways. In addition, a simplified empirical soot model is embedded in the mechanism for simulating the soot formation process in the oxidation of the furanic fuels. The resulting mechanism, consisting of 145 species and 643 reactions, has been evaluated against the ignition delays, speciation profiles, laminar flame speeds as well as the soot mass measured from the combustion of the furanic fuels in the literature. The simulation results in general match satisfactorily well with the experimental data, suggesting the high performance of the proposed mechanism. The performance of the reaction mechanism for engine combustion simulation is also tested. A four-cylinder compression ignition engine is simulated using a coupled KIVA4-CHEMKIN code package. The influences of DMF on the engine combustion characteristics and soot emissions are investigated. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass such as switchgrass can be converted to n-butanol using fermentation, which can be further processed into jet fuel. Traditional acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation only converts sugars derived from switchgrass to ABE. Novel co-fermentation processes convert sugars and gas (CO2/H2) produced during fermentation into butanol, thus increasing ABE yields by 15.5% compared to traditional ABE fermentation. Herein, the environmental impact of a Switchgrass to Jet Fuel (STJ) pathway was assessed using life cycle assessment (LCA) from well-to-wake. LCAs were performed for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from jet fuel production via co-fermentation of sugars and gas for ideal and practical cases of ABE fermentation and seven other jet fuel pathways. The ideal case assumes 100% sugar recovery and 95% ABE yield. The practical case assumes 90% sugar recovery and an 80% ABE yield. Results are presented based on 100-year global warming potential (GWP) per MJ of jet fuel. Co-products were allocated using various methods. The increase in butanol yield via the co-fermentation technology reduced GWP-100 for the STJ pathway by 6.5% compared to traditional ABE fermentation. Similarly, the STJ pathway for the practical case with co-fermentation had 14.2%, 47.5%, 73.8%, and 44.4% less GWP-100 compared to HRJ, Fischer-Tropsch jet fuel from switchgrass, Fischer-Tropsch jet fuel from coal, and conventional petroleum jet fuel. The results demonstrate that the STJ pathway via co-fermentation has the potential to increase product yield while reducing GHG emissions compared to other jet fuel production pathways. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Innovative fluorescence security technologies for paper-based information are still highly pursued nowadays because data leakage and indelibility have become serious economic and social problems. Herein, we report a novel transient bio-fluorochromic supramolecular co-assembly mediated by a hydrolytic enzyme (ALP: alkaline phosphatase) towards rewritable security printing. A co-assembly based on the designed tetrabranched cationic diethynylanthracene monomer tends to be formed by adding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as the biofuel. The resulting co-assembly possesses a time-encoded bio-fluorochromic feature, upon successively hydrolyzing ATP with ALP and re-adding new batches of ATP. On this basis, the dynamic fluorescent properties of this time-encoded co-assembly system have been successfully enabled in rewritable security patternsviaan inkjet printing technique, providing fascinating potential for fluorescence security materials with a biomimetic mode. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Direct and selective production of C3+ olefins from bioethanol remains a critical challenge and important for the production of renewable transportation fuels such as aviation biofuels. Here, we report a Cu-Zn-Y/Beta catalyst for selective ethanol conversion to butene-rich C3+ olefins (88% selectivity at 100% ethanol conversion, 623 K), where the Cu, Zn, and Y sites are all highly dispersed. The ethanol-to-butene reaction network includes ethanol dehydrogenation, aldol condensation to crotonaldehyde, and hydrogenation to butyraldehyde, followed by further hydrogenation and dehydration reactions to form butenes. Cu sites play a critical role in promoting hydrogenation of the crotonaldehyde C=C bond to form butyraldehyde in the presence of hydrogen, making this a distinctive pathway from crotyl alcohol-based ethanol-to-butadiene reaction. Reaction rate measurements in the presence of ethanol and acetaldehyde (543 K, 12 kPa ethanol, 1.2 kPa acetaldehyde, 101.9 kPa H2) over monometallic Zn/Beta and Y/Beta catalysts indicate that Y sites have higher C-C coupling rates than over Zn sites (initial C-C coupling rate, 6.1 × 10-3 mol molY-1 s-1 vs 1.2 × 10-3 mol molZn-1 s-1). Further, Lewis-acidic Y-site densities over Cu-Zn-Y/Beta with varied Y loadings are linearly correlated with the initial C-C coupling rates, suggesting that Lewis-acidic Y sites are the predominant sites that catalyze C-C coupling in Cu-Zn-Y/Beta catalysts. Control experiments show that the dealuminated Beta support is important to form higher density of Lewis-acidic Y sites in comparison with other supports such as silica, or deboronated MWW despite similar atomic dispersion of Y sites and Y-O coordination numbers over these supports, leading to more than 9 times higher C-C coupling rate per mole Y over dealuminated Beta relative to other supports. This study highlights the significance of unique combination of metal sites in contributing to the selective valorization of ethanol to C3+ olefins, motivating for exploring multifunctional zeolite catalysts, where the presence of multiple sites with varying reactivities and functions allows for controlling the predominant molecular fluxes toward the desired products in complex reactions. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Cellobiulose (glucosyl-fructose, GF), as a dominant primary product from cellobiose isomerization during hydrothermal conversion, plays a key role in the production of biofuels and biochemicals from biomass or cellulose, but the reaction mechanism of GF hydrothermal decomposition remains largely unclear. For the first time in the field, this study reports a systematic investigation into the fundamental reaction mechanism of GF hydrothermal decomposition using a continuous reactor at 200-250 °C and 10 MPa. The GF conversion increases with reaction temperature and residence time, with a high conversion of 91% achieved at 250 °C and ∼52 s. The experimental results demonstrate that GF hydrothermal decomposition proceeds with several primary reactions: (1) hydrolysis to produce glucose and fructose, (2) isomerization to produce cellobiose and glucosyl-mannose (GM), and (3) retro-aldol condensation to produce glucosyl-erythrose (GE) and glycolaldehyde. Among all primary reactions, the hydrolysis reaction plays a key role during GF decomposition, contributing to ∼60% of the primary decomposition reactions of GF at 200 °C, while isomerization and retro-aldol condensation reactions only contribute to ∼31 and ∼9% of the primary decomposition reactions of GF at 200 °C. Those primary products are further decomposed to various secondary products (mainly furans, aldehydes, and organic acids). Particularly, various organic acids (i.e., saccharinic acid, formic acid, lactic acid) produced at the early stage of GF decomposition can further catalyze the primary reactions of GF and the secondary reactions of primary products. This study clearly demonstrates that isomerization of cellobiose to GF plays a key role in the breakage of the glycosidic bond during noncatalytic hydrothermal decomposition of cellobiose, providing new insights into the fundamental reaction mechanism of sugar oligomer hydrothermal decomposition for producing renewable biofuels and biochemicals. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Co-hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of wastewater algae and crude glycerol has been shown to produce higher yields at lower costs compared to wastewater algae biomass conversion alone. The biocrude oil produced from co-HTL of wastewater algae and crude glycerol does, however, have a relatively high oxygen content (10-16 wt %) and relatively low energy content (34-36 MJ/kg). To upgrade the biocrude oil to high-quality biofuel and to simplify the overall process, several organic solvents were evaluated for their ability to extract biocrude oil from the HTL products and to donate hydrogen for biocrude oil upgrading. The solvent options tested were hexane, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, and no solvent, in combination with effective heterogeneous upgrading catalysts: H-beta zeolite, Pt/C, and Raney Ni. Biocrude oil yields varied with the polarity of solvent; as expected, solvents with high polarity led to more extraction of biocrude oil albeit with lower quality. Pt/C was the most effective catalyst for upgrading, producing a light-colored, low-viscosity liquid with lower oxygen content (0.01 wt %) and higher energy content (44 MJ/kg). The choice of solvent had relatively little effect on upgrading outcomes compared to the selection of the catalyst. The no solvent with Pt/C and the ethyl acetate with Pt/C combinations were the most promising, resulting in an upgraded oil energy content similar to gasoline and a near complete removal of oxygen. The combination of ethyl acetate and Pt/C resulted in a higher energy recovery. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Furanic ethers including furfuryl ether (FE) and tetrahydrofurfuryl ether (TFE) are considered as boosters for raising the octane number and cetane number, respectively. In this work, heterogeneous catalysts are used to synthesize FE from furfuryl alcohol and are found to be effective, and then they hydrogenate FE into TFE. Among the solid acids including HZSM-5, SiO2-Al2O3, SiO2, and Al2O3, it was discovered that the SiO2-Al2O3 complex with about 2.0% Al2O3 content exhibited excellent activity with 69% ethyl furfuryl ether (EFE) yield achieved. SiO2-Al2O3 demonstrated a decrease in its activity after being recycled six times. However, after calcination, SiO2-Al2O3 regained its activity. SiO2-Al2O3 maintained its activity and stability due to the Lewis acid site and the large pore size. In situ hydrogenation of EFE into ethyl tetrahydrofuran ether was performed using Ru/C, Pd/C, Pd/Al2O3, Raney Ni, Ni/Al2O3, Ni/CeO2, and Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Only Raney Ni demonstrated both high activity and stability. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, a novel adsorbent, Air Environment-prepared Adsorbent at 250 ℃ (AEPA250), was used to detoxify the main fermentation inhibitor (ferulic acid) present in the alkali-pretreated hydrolysate. AEPA250 reduced the effective concentration of ferulic acid by its adsorption, thereby decreasing the possible interaction of ferulic acid with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results indicated that AEPA250 functionalized with hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups under acidic conditions with higher binding energies (−45.667, −27.046, and −11.008 kcal mol−1, respectively) and electronic cloud overlap and shorter bond distances (1.015, 1.010, and 2.094 Å, respectively) than those under the other pH conditions. These differences revealed that the electrostatic interaction dominated ferulic acid adsorption on AEPA250. Additionally, under acidic conditions and for carboxyl group functionalized AEPA250, energy band gap values of Eg1 were higher than those of Eg2, indicating that ferulic acid provided the π-electrons for the π-π electron donor-acceptor interactions with AEPA250. Furthermore, ferulic acid detoxification after AEPA250 adsorption caused the regulation of YDR316W-B and YPR137C-B genes of S. cerevisiae. These results might contribute to the development of other more efficient adsorbents and pretreatment methods and allow yeast engineering for improving the scale-up and self-sufficient production of bioethanol in the future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Methane is the main component of biogas, which could be used as a renewable energy source for electricity, source of heat, and biofuel production after upgrading from biogas. It also contains toxic compounds which cause environmental and human health problems. Therefore, in this work, the removal of a toxic compound (toluene) from methane gas was studied using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor. It was observed that the removal of the toxic compound could be achieved from methane carrier gas using a dielectric barrier discharge reactor, and it depends on plasma input power. The maximum removal of the toxic compound was 85.9% at 40 W and 2.86 s. The major gaseous products were H2 and lower hydrocarbons (LHC) and the yield of these products also increases with input power. In the current study, the yield of gaseous products depends on the decomposition of toxic compounds and methane, because the decomposition of methane also produces H2 and lower hydrocarbons. The percentage yield of H2 increases from 0.43-4.74%. Similarly, the yield of LHC increases from 0.56-7.54% under the same reaction conditions. Hence, input power promoted the decomposition of the toxic compound and enhanced the yield of gaseous products. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Autothermal reforming of bioethanol (ATR of C2H5OH) over promoted Ni/Ce0.8La0.2O1.9 catalysts was studied to develop carbon-neutral technologies for hydrogen production. The regulation of the functional properties of the catalysts was attained by adjusting their nanostructure and reducibility by introducing various types and content of M promoters (M = Pt, Pd, Rh, Re; molar ratio M/Ni = 0.003–0.012). The composition–characteristics–activity correlation was determined using catalyst testing in ATR of C2H5OH, thermal analysis, N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and EDX analysis. It was shown that the type and content of the promoter, as well as the preparation mode (combined or sequential impregnation methods), determine the redox properties of catalysts and influence the textural and structural characteristics of the samples. The reducibility of catalysts improves in the following sequence of promoters: Re < Rh < Pd < Pt, with an increase in their content, and when using the co-impregnation method. It was found that in ATR of C2H5OH over bimetallic Ni-M/Ce0.8Lа0.2O1.9 catalysts at 600 °C, the hydrogen yield increased in the following row of promoters: Pt < Rh < Pd < Re at 100% conversion of ethanol. The introduction of M leads to the formation of a NiM alloy under reaction conditions and affects the resistance of the catalyst to oxidation, sintering, and coking. It was found that for enhancing Ni catalyst performance in H2 production through ATR of C2H5OH, the most effective promotion is with Re: at 600 °C over the optimum 10Ni-0.4Re/Ce0.8Lа0.2O1.9 catalyst the highest hydrogen yield 65% was observed. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Low-acid hydrothermal (LAH) fractionation conditions were optimized for the effective degradation of hemicellulose from pine wood (Pinus densiflora). The hemicellulosic sugar yield was maximized at 82.5% when the pine wood was fractionated at 190 °C, with 0.5 wt.% of sulfuric acid, and for 10 min. Consecutively, acidified heat treatment with zinc chloride and solvent extraction with ethyl acetate were carried out for the recovery of bio-based platform chemicals, such as furfural and acetic acid, from liquid hydrolysate through liquid–liquid extraction (LLE). Overall, 61.5% of xylose was decomposed into furfural, and the yield of acetic acid was 62.3% and furfural 66.1%. After LAH fractionation, 64.8% of the solid remained and was pelletized. The pellets showed excellent fuel characteristics, i.e., significant ash rejection (74.5%) and high calorific values (4770 kcal/kg), and the precursors of NOx and SOx also decreased by up to 60.0% and 71.4%, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Low or zero carbon fuels are crucial for maritime transportation decarbonization goals. This paper assesses potential localities for maritime biofuels (biobunkers) production in Brazil, Europe, South Africa, and United States considering geographical, logistic, and economic aspects. This assessment combines georeferenced and techno‐economic analyses to identify suitable fuel production hotspots based on not only plant performance and costs but also on logistic integration and biomass seasonality. Five technology pathways were considered: Straight vegetable Oils (SVO), Hydrotreated Vegetable Oils (HVO), Fischer–Tropsch Biomass‐to‐liquids (FT‐BTL), Alcohol oligomerization to middle distillates (ATD), and Hydrotreated Pyrolysis Oil (HDPO). Findings reveal that biomass concentration in Brazil makes it the region with highest biobunker potential, which are mostly close to coastal areas and surpasses regional demand. Although other regions registered more limited potentials, hotspots proximity to ports would enable fossil fuel replacements in these areas. For all cases, biobunker costs (USD 21–104/GJ) are higher than conventional marine fuels prices (USD 11–17/GJ). Only 15% of the hotspots’ carbon prices that would allow its competitiveness are lower than USD 100/tCO2. Alternatives to incentivize biobunker production would be, first, to establish mandatory fuel blends and second, to join forces with other sectors that would be benefited from the co‐production of advanced biofuels. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Vegetable oils are considered to be eco-friendly and to offer good lubricant properties; however, their low thermo-oxidative stability makes their use as a lubricant base challenging. In this research, sunflower, almond, and rapeseed vegetable oils were added in volumes of 5, 10, 15, and 20% to a machinery oil, and the thermal properties of the resulting fluids were studied. Sunflower, almond, and rapeseed oils were chosen considering their fatty acid composition and the tocopherol content. During this investigation, thermal diffusivity was measured by using the thermal wave resonance cavity technique, while thermal effusivity was determined by the inverse photopyroelectric method, and the obtained values ranged from 4.63 to 5.75 Ws1/2m−2K−1 × 102 . The thermal conductivity was calculated by obtaining a complete thermal characterization. The results showed a linear relationship between the percentage of vegetable oil and the thermal diffusivity. It was also noted that the thermal properties of diffusivity and effusivity could be tuned when using almond, sunflower, and rapeseed oils in the appropriate percentages. Hence, the influence of vegetable oils on the thermal properties of lubricating oil were closely related to the number of fatty acids. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The maritime transportation sector (MTS) is undertaking a major global effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), e.g., sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and the concentration of particulates in suspension. Substantial investment is necessary to develop alternative sustainable fuels, engines, and fuel modifications. The alternative fuels considered in this study include liquified natural gas, nuclear energy, hydrogen, electricity, and biofuels. This paper focuses on biofuels, in particular fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO), a serious partial alternative in MTS. There are some drawbacks, e.g., biofuels usually require land necessary to produce the feedstock and the chemical compatibility of the resulting biofuel with current engines in MTS. The demand for sustainable feedstock production for MTS can be overcome by using cellulose-based and agroforestry residues, which do not compete with food production and can be obtained in large quantities and at a reasonably low cost. The compatibility of biofuels with either bunker fuel or diesel cycle engines can also be solved by upgrading biofuels, adjusting the refining process, or modifying the engine itself. The paper examines the possibilities presented by biofuels, focusing on FPBO in Brazil, for MTS. The key issues investigated include FPBO, production, and end use of feedstocks and the most promising alternatives; thermal conversion technologies; potential applications of FPBO in Brazil; sustainability; biofuels properties; fuels under consideration in MTS, challenges, and opportunities in a rapidly changing maritime fuel sector. Although the focus is on Brazil, the findings of this paper can be replicated in many other parts of the world. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Several countries have set ambitious targets for the transport sector that mandate a gradual increase in advanced biofuel content in the coming years. The current work addresses this transition and indicates two promising gasoline bio-blendstocks: anisole and isobutanol. The whole value chains of these bio-components were considered, focusing on end-use performance, but also analyz-ing feedstock and its conversion, well-to wheel (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and costs. Three alternative fuels, namely a ternary blend (15% anisole, 15% isobutanol, 70% fossil gasoline on an energy basis) and two binary blends (15% anisole with fossil gasoline and 30% isobutanol with fossil gasoline), were tested, focusing on their drop-in applicability in spark ignition (SI) engines. The formulated liquid fuels performed well and showed the potential to increase brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 1.4% on average. Measured unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were increased on average by 12–29% and 17–51%, respectively. However, HC and CO concentrations and exhaust temperatures were at acceptable levels for proper catalyst operation. The studied blends were estimated to bring 11–22% of WTW GHG emission reductions compared to base gasoline. Additionally, the fleet performance and benefits of flexi-fuel vehicles (FFV) were modeled for ternary blends. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of thermal transformations of model lignin compounds (MLC) over nanoscale catalysts is important for improving the technologic processes occurring in the pyrolytic conversion of lignocellulose biomass into biofuels and value-added chemicals. Herein, we investigate catalytic pyrolysis of MLC (pyrocatechol (P), guaiacol (G), ferulic (FA), and vanillic acids (VA)) over nanoceria using FT-IR spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry (TPD MS), and thermogravimetric analysis (DTG/DTA/TG). FT-IR spectroscopic studies indicate that the active groups of aromatic rings of P, G, VA, and FA as well as carboxylate groups of VA and FA are involved in the interaction with nanoceria surface. We explore the general transformation mechanisms of different surface complexes and identify their decomposition products. We demonstrate that decomposition of carboxylate acid complexes occurs by decarboxylation. When FA is used as a precursor, this reaction generates 4-vinylguaiacol. Complexes of VA and FA formed through both active groups of the aromatic ring and decompose on the CeO2 surface to generate hydroxybenzene. The formation of alkylated products accompanies catalytic pyrolysis of acids due to processes of transalkylation on the surface. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Hydrotalcites (HTCs) are promising solid base catalysts to produce advanced biofuels by aldol condensation. Their main potential lies in the tunability of their acid-base properties by vary-ing their composition. However, the relationship between the composition of hydrotalcites, their basicity, and their catalytic performance has not yet been fully revealed. Here, we investigate sys-tematically the preparation of HTCs with the general formula of Mg6M3+2(OH)16CO3·4H2O, where M3+ stands for Al, Ga, Fe, and In, while keeping the Mg/M3+ equal to 3. We use an array of analytical methods including XRD, N2 physisorption, CO2-TPD, TGA-MS, FTIR-ATR, and SEM to assess changes in the properties and concluded that the nature of M3+ affected the HTC crystallinity. We show that the basicity of the HTC-derived mixed oxides decreased with the increase in atomic weight of M3+, which was reflected by decreased furfural conversion in its aldol condensation with acetone. We demonstrate that all MgM3+ mixed oxides can be fully rehydrated, which boosted their activity in aldol condensation. Taking all characterization results together, we conclude that the catalytic performance of the rehydrated HTCs is determined by the “host” MgO component, rather than the nature of M3+. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, a new green integrated process for biodiesel ester production was developed, consisting of the enzymatic transesterification of acid oil from macaúba palm tree (Acrocomia aculeata) catalyzed by dry fermented solid (DFS) with lipase activity, which was obtained from solid-state fermentation (SSF) of macaúba cake. Analysis of statistical experimental designs showed that nitrogen supplementation of macaúba cake improved production of lipases displaying esterification capacity by Rhizomucor miehei. The conditions chosen to produce R. miehei DFS were cake supplementation with 2 wt% urea, 60 wt% of initial moisture during 48 h of fermentation at 40°C. DFS showed, by zymography assays, at least one enzyme that was different from those that are present in the commercial lipase of R. miehei. Furthermore, DFS was used in transesterification reactions between macaúba acid oil and alcohol (methanol or ethanol), and the ester content obtained was 92%. This is the first time that this integrated process using low-cost biocatalysts and a low-value oil derived from the processing of the same fruit was used for biodiesel ester production, reducing costs and logistic constraints, and optimizing the raw material utilization. © 2021 AOCS.

AB  - This study focuses on the valorization of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (biopulp) by hydrothermal liquefaction. Thereby, homogeneous alkali catalysts (KOH, NaOH, K2CO3, and Na2CO3) and a residual aqueous phase recirculation methodology were mutually employed to enhance the bio-crude yield and energy efficiency of a sub-critical hydrothermal conversion (350 °C, 15–20 Mpa, 15 min). Interestingly, single recirculation of the concentrated aqueous phase positively increased the bio-crude yield in all cases, while the higher heating value (HHV) of the bio-crudes slightly dropped. Compared to the non-catalytic experiment, K2CO3 and Na2CO3 effectively increased the bio-crude yield by 14 and 7.3%, respectively. However, KOH and NaOH showed a negative variation in the bio-crude yield. The highest bio-crude yield (37.5 wt.%) and energy recovery (ER) (59.4%) were achieved when K2CO3 and concentrated aqueous phase recirculation were simultaneously applied to the process. The inorganics distribution results obtained by ICP reveal the tendency of the alkali elements to settle into the aqueous phase, which, if recovered, can potentially boost the circularity of the HTL process. Therefore, wise selection of the alkali catalyst along with aqueous phase recirculation assists hydrothermal liquefaction in green biofuel production and environmentally friendly valorization of biopulp. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The aqueous phase reforming (APR) of glycerol was studied using sonochemically synthesized 10%Ni-x%Ca/ZrO2 catalysts (where x = 0, 0.5, 3, and 5) for the production of value-added liquid products. The APR reaction was performed in a batch reactor under the following conditions: 20 bar, 230◦C 450 rpm, and 1 h of reaction time. The synthesized catalysts were characterized using XRD, FESEM, BET, and H2-TPR to observe the effect of Ca doping on the physio-chemical properties of the catalysts. The results revealed that, at higher Ca loading, the catalysts experienced serious particles’ agglomeration, which resulted in a larger particles’ size, smaller surface area, and smaller pore volume owing to uneven distribution of the particles. The characterization results of the catalysts confirmed that the Us catalysts have a slightly higher surface area, pore volume, and pore size, as well as highly reducible and fine crystalline structure, compared with WI catalysts. The catalytic performance of the catalysts shows that 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) were the two main liquid products produced from this reaction. The highest selectivity of 1,3-PDO (23.84%) was obtained over the 10%Ni/ZrO2 catalyst, while the highest selectivity of 1,2-PDO (25.87%) was obtained over the 10%Ni-5%Ca/ZrO2 catalyst. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Natural microalgae (NA, cyanobacteria) collected from Taihu Lake (Jiangsu, China) were used for biofuel production through pyrolysis. The microalgae were de-ashed via pretreatment with deionized water and hydrochloric acid, and the samples obtained were noted as 0 M, 0.1 M, 1 M, 2 M, 4 M, 6 M, 8 M, respectively, according to the concentration of hydrochloric acid used in the pretreatment. Pyrolysis experiments were carried out at 500 °C for 2 h. The products were examined by various techniques to identify the influence of the ash on the pyrolysis behavior. The results showed that the ash inhibited the thermal transformation of microalgae. The 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid performed the best in removing ash and the liquid yield increased from 34.4% (NA) to 40.5% (2M). Metal-oxides (mainly CaO, MgO, Al2O3) in ash promoted the reaction of hexadecanoic acid and NH3 to produce more hexadecanamide, which was further dehydrated to hexadecanenitrile. After acid pretreatment, significant improvement in the selectivity of hexadecanoic acid was observed, ranging from 22.4% (NA) to 58.8% (4M). The hydrocarbon compounds in the liquid product increased from 12.90% (NA) to 26.67% (2M). Furthermore, the acid pretreatment enhanced the content of C9–C16 compounds and the HHV values of bio-oil. For natural microalgae, the deashing pretreatment before pyrolysis was essential for improving the biocrude yield and quality, as well as the biomass conversion efficiency. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The one-pot hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of an aqueous sorbitol solution (20 wt%) was studied over Pd (0.5 wt%)/WOx–ZrO2 catalyst at the variable reaction conditions in a continuous mode focusing on the effect of the calcination temperature of tungstated zirconia (1073 and 1223 К), the Pd containing catalyst reduction temperature, as well as on the correlation between their physical-chemical properties and fuel hydrocarbons yield. It was found that sorbitol HDO under reaction conditions such as temperatures 573 and 613 K, hydrogen pressure 4.0 MPa, and WHSV of 1.0 h–1 resulted in the highest yield of C5+ hydrocarbons 76–81 mol% mainly consisting of isoalkanes, cycloalkanes, n–alkanes and arenes. The maximum yield of the targeted isoalkanes and cycloalkanes with RON&gt;70 (34 mol%) along with the minimum amount of undesirable C6–C8 arenes (2 mol%) were obtained at 613 K. Under these conditions the Pd catalyst reduced at 613 K using tungstated zirconia calcined at 1073 K as a support afforded formation of Pd/WOx–ZrO2 with the optimal microtexture, acidity and dispersion of catalytically active phase. Physicochemical properties of the catalyst and support were studied by XRD, low temperature N2 physical adsorption, NH3–TPD, H2–TPR, CO chemisorption, XPS, and CO2–TPD. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nanoparticles have become omnipresent as they have distinctively diverse properties from their bulk counterparts. They find a considerable research interest in numerous biological, biomedical, biopharmaceutical, and biochemical applications. The productivity and structure of nanoparticles are deeply reliant on the method used for their synthesis. The classical hydrothermal method needs massive and expensive temperature controller instruments, a huge amount of reagents, and specific autoclaves for their synthesis. With this motivation, herein, an automated, integrated, and miniaturized thermal monitoring system has been designed and developed for producing nanoparticle-on-chip (NoC) in a microfluidic platform. Herein, Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were synthesized. The device comprises a microcontroller, self-designed switching circuit, cartridge heater, and thermocouple. The device, with dimensions 78 × 75 × 40 mm3, has benefits such as portability, easy-to-use, amenability to geotagged data logging, and inexpensive. The device showcased the temperature sensitivity of ± 0.5 °C. A polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-based microfluidic device, with a suitable microreactor, was fabricated using the CO2 laser ablation technique. ZnO nanoparticles were successfully synthesized at 95 °C within 60 min and were subjected to several characterization techniques to manifest their crystographic, elemental, morphologic, and spectroscopic properties. As a proof-of-principle, the produced ZnO nanoparticles were validated for electrocatalytic sensing of hydrazine and uric acid, and as a catalyst in an enzymatic glucose biofuel cell (EBFC) to test its efficiency. The proposed microfluidic thermal system can be utilized for carrying out numerous temperature-based reactions and analyses. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis of waste from agroindustry may be an alternative choice for sustainable use of enhanced biofuels. Plastics are one option for improving the hydrogen to carbon efficiency ratio (H/Ceff) of biomass feedstock. Waste from agroindustry in blends with biomass could modify the reaction mechanism for removing oxygen by substituting decarbonylation and decarboxylation with dehydration. Firstly, fast pyrolysis was performed to find the optimal mass blending ratio for olive pomace (OP) and agroindustrial polymers (polyethylene (PE), polystyrenes (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) according to hydrocarbon production. Experimental results for the 1.5:1 OP/PE, 1:1.5 OP/PS and 1:1.5 OP/PVC mass blending ratios at 500 °C, showed synergistic enhancement of hydrocarbon yields. Alkenes yield were enhanced for 1.5:1 OP/PE, where the light hydrocarbons fraction (C6-C10) first increased and then decreased with temperature, reaching a maximum at 650 °C. For 1:1.5 OP/PS and 1:1.5 OP/PVC, it was improved the aromatic compounds formation, being 500 °C and 650 °C the optimal reaction temperature for the former and the later, respectively. Benzene, toluene and xylene were in large quantities obtained for PS and PVC blends with OP. Additionally, the synergistic effect on pyrolysis of the blends did not show any clear trend for pyrolytic gas emissions. In general, as reaction temperature increased, CO and CO2 emissions fell and CH4 was enhanced. Finally, olefin and aromatic yields were promoted for blends with a higher H/Ceff. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The removal of nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) from biocrude oil produced using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), is important for the production of high quality renewable fuels. Here the effect of co-liquefaction of bagasse and algae was analysed. Algae (Chlorella vulgaris and Cyanobacteria) were mixed with bagasse (1:1) subjected to HTL at 250–350 °C for 10–60 min. Higher HTL temperatures had a positive effect in increasing the biocrude yield and slightly reduced N content; S did not show a consistent trend. Most of the nitrogen (~66%) and sulphur (~80%) were recovered in the aqueous phase rather than in the biocrude phase, opening the opportunity to recycle these nutrients for algae cultivation. Co-liquefying bagasse with algae improved the biocrude yield (54 wt%) compared to pure Cyanobacteria (47.5 wt%). It also reduced N content from 7 wt% (Cyanobacteria biocrude) to 4.2 wt% (Cyanobacteria: Bagasse) and S from 0.7 wt% to 0.4 wt%. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis identified that biocrude yield is positively correlated with the initial lipid content and anti-correlated with the carbohydrates fraction. Biocrude N content is closely related to the initial amount of proteins in the algae. The Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment of Evaluations and its descriptive complement Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Aid (PROMETHEE and GAIA) analysis ranked the co-liquefaction of Chlorella vulgaris and bagasse (1:1) at 350 °C and 60 min as one of the best overall combination in terms of biocrude yield, N and S content. © 2021

AB  - In particular, a straw-based Ablative Fast Pyrolysis (AFP) oil was upgraded via hydrotreatment (HDT) in order to be used as a blending component with fossil-based intermediates. The raw pyrolysis oil is characterized by H/C = 0.14, O/C = 0.58 and C = 57.73 wt%, while the HDT pyrolysis oil has a H/C = 0.14, O/C = 0.016 and C = 85.85 wt%. Based on the density, viscosity and composition, and in association with a typical refinery, the possible petroleum refinery entry points for HDT pyrolysis oil include Straight Run Gas-Oil (SRGO), Atmospheric Gas-oil (GO), Fluid Catalytic Cracking Light Cycle Oil (LCO) and Heavy Cycle Oil (HCO), as well as Light Vacuum Gas-Oil (LVGO). To that aim, this work examined raw and HDT bio-oil blends with the aforementioned candidate petroleum streams at a 30:70 v/v ratio (raw or HDT bio-oil/petroleum stream) with respect to their miscibility, by comparing the blend components’ properties, microscopic observation, and interfacial tension analysis. From the microscopic observation, the addition of HDT pyrolysis oil in all examined petroleum candidates renders a homogeneous mixture where the two phases cannot be distinguished. In addition, no interfacial tension was observed in the examined blends, while the blend of HDT pyrolysis oil with the different petroleum streams not only did not deteriorate the fuel characteristics over the original petroleum stream, but also it improved them, in some cases. In general, the HDT pyrolysis oil was found to be miscible with all the examined refinery streams, extending the potential further investigation of stabilized pyrolysis oil integration over oil refineries. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Sustainable production of biofuel and chemical feedstock through catalytic hydrogenation has now received increased attention due to the expeditious depletion of crude oil. In the present investigation, we developed a cost-effective and base metal-based NiCu/Laponite catalyst for liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural into fuel range components. The robust catalysts were prepared by a simple co-impregnation method with constant loading of 5 wt% NiO with different wt.% of CuO (x) loadings (where x = 8, 10, 12 &amp; 14%) on the Laponite support. The textural properties, surface acidity, and reduction of the synthesized catalysts were studied by employing various physicochemical characterizations such as XRD, N2 sorption analysis, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, and TGA. The obtained results revealed that optimum loading of 12% CuO and 5% NiO catalyst aids fine dispersion of copper and nickel oxide on the surface of the support. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images displayed the delamination of Laponite particles and dispersion of Ni-Cu catalyst on the support surface. The hydrogenation efficiency of the synthesized catalysts was tested in a bench top stainless steel autoclave reactor by liquid phase reaction condition of furfural at 150–210 °C under 10–25 bar H2 pressure for 1–6 h. The excellent activity of 5Ni-12Cu/Laponite catalysts was compared and correlated with the physicochemical characteristics of the catalyst. © 2021 The Society of Powder Technology Japan

AB  - The hydrochar, a by-product of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algal biomass, was utilized through two methods; combustion and activation, for its usage as a source of heat and a catalyst support for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process in the production of algal biofuels. In this study, techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) of algal biofuels production in a two-stage process (HTL and HDO) were investigated. Aspen plus simulation and SimaPro software were used to analyze process economics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Microalgae at 200 dry metric tonnes day−1 was the basis for its conversion to biocrude oil through HTL in the methanol-water system followed by catalytic upgrading to produce biofuels. According to HTL experimental results, maximum biocrude oil yield of 57.8 wt% was obtained using microalgae-solvent mass ratio and methanol-water mass ratio of 1:5 and 3:1, respectively. Produced biocrude oil contained 14.5 wt% of oxygen and HHV of 33.4 MJ kgbiocrude oil−1 which required upgrading to be utilized as a transportation fuel. HDO was employed to enhance the quality of biocrude oil with decrease in oxygen content (3.1 wt%) and increase in HHV (42 MJ kgbiofuel−1). The minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) for using method #2 (activation) was 2.2 $ L−1 to breakeven the cost of operation, which was about 10% lower than that from method #1 (combustion). The GHG emissions performance was estimated at −1.13 gCO2-eq MJ−1 indicating the significant GHG emissions reduction compared to petroleum-based fuels production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As a result of anthropocentric climate change, there is an urgent need to decarbonize the supply of energy. Organic biomass, referred to as feedstock, can be converted into biofuels that have the potential to decarbonize transport. However, biofuels are typically not carbon neutral because the preparation of feedstocks and the production of biofuels require energy currently supplied by fossil fuels, which involve carbon emissions. This work aimed to bring biofuel research up to date with current UK policy of net zero carbon emissions by examining the volume of carbon-neutral advanced biofuels that could be produced from sustainable feedstocks generated in the UK. By analyzing relevant data, it is estimated that between 667 and 1,791 million litres (Mltr) of carbon-neutral biodiesel equivalent could be produced with the energy content of 22.7-60.9 PJ, corresponding to 8.1%-21.7% of current diesel consumption by heavy goods vehicles in the UK. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Many studies have focused on effective ways to exploit enzyme immobilization on an electrode surface to help improve the performance of enzymatic electrochemical biosensors. Herein, a novel glucose sensor was fabricated by immobilizing glucose oxidase (GOx) onruthenium-based conjugated polymer (CP) and metal-organic framework (MOF) nanocomposites. This has not only reduced the applied potential to 0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), but also improved the effective surface area for enzyme immobilization.PPG@Ru@UiO-66-NH2 was tailored by controlled chemical synthesis from a pre-synthesized water-soluble conjugated polymer (poly(N-phenylglycine)) and metal-organic framework (UiO-66-NH2). The resulting nanocomposites were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The PPG@Ru@UiO-66-NH2/GOx coated electrodedisplayed a linear measurementrange for glucose from 1 mM to 10 mM, with a sensitivity of 45.92 μA ⋅ mM−1cm−1 and limit of detection of5 μM((Formula presented.)). Furthermore, the practical application of the fabricatedglucosesensor was tested in simulative blood samples with satisfactoryaccuracy. This approach alsoopens a new door for applications regarding both enzymatic electrochemical biosensors and enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs). © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - To promote the use of waste-originated resources in biodiesel production, this study proposes the utilization of leather tanning waste (LTW) and crab-shell (CS) waste as the respective lipid source and catalyst material. The obtained CS-based calcium oxide (CaO) has comparable textural properties with those of existing waste-based catalysts and shows high catalytic activity for the conversion of LTW to biodiesel. The optimum yield of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) is predicted at 97.9 wt%, while it is experimentally observed at 98.7 ± 0.4 wt% (purity of 98.6 ± 0.4 wt%) using the following operating condition: reaction time t = 3.58 h, catalyst amount mc = 3.87 wt%, and a molar ratio of ethanol to LTW meo = 12:1. The CS-based CaO shows good reusability with FAEE yield staying above 90 wt% for four cycles. The fuel properties of LTW-based biodiesel meet ASTM D6751 and ASTM D975-08 standards, with the ethyl ester ranging from C14 to C20. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Materials which synergistically combine Lewis and Brønsted acid properties hold potential for applications as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for preparation of biofuels and biolubricants. Herein we report new heterogeneous catalysts based on grafting the intact Lewis metal (ZrIV) substituted Keggin polyoxometalate (POM) on mesoporous silica support. A new approach for immobilization of the POM in MCM-41 silica was developed by co-condensation of Si source (tetraethyl orthosilicate, TEOS) with POM salt in the presence of a template molecule as an alternative to the commonly used acidic POM form and impregnation procedure for catalyst preparation. The proposed synthesis method in combination with extraction of the template proceeded with preservation of the intact POM structure and resulted in hybrid catalysts with in situ generated Brønsted acid sites in addition to the Lewis acidity provided by the metal centers. Textural properties of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 physisorption and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Insight into POM stability and structural transformations during synthesis, template removal and impregnation was provided by solid state 31P and 29Si NMR spectroscopy. Catalytic activity was studied in esterification reactions of levulinic acid with ethanol or octanol to value-added esters. The directly synthesized POM-functionalized hybrid catalysts exceeded the post synthesis impregnated ones, demonstrating significantly higher catalytic activity, recyclability and resistance against leaching. The proposed approach for immobilization of Lewis metal POMs in MCM-41 silica framework with in situ generation of the active Brønsted acid sites opens prospects for the development of efficient hybrid catalysts for esterification reaction, which overcomes the main limitations of common POM based catalysts such as low stability of the acid sites during the synthesis and the catalytic reaction, low surface area, agglomeration of the catalytically active phase and low stability of the Lewis metal center in presence of water. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Vegetable oil fuels, such as bio-oil, stand out as biofuel. For the production of bio-oil, a widely used system is the cracking process, which aims to decompose the triacylglycerides of vegetable oil into hydrocarbons and free fatty acids. The Fodder radish (Raphanus sativus L.) was selected as a raw material and the oil was subjected to thermal cracking at three temperatures, 400, 600 and 800 °C. The bio-oils obtained have chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers and ketones and the absence of aromatic compounds, which are harmful to health. The physical-chemical properties of bio-oils showed a high acidity and water content. The esterification of the bio-oils was made using a simple and easy method and the esterification contributed to improve the physico-chemical properties of the bio-oil, and CONF-e 600 being the esterified bio-oil with the highest amount of hydrocarbons. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The lack of effective lignin valorization technology remains a major barrier to utilize lignocellulose for producing biofuels and biochemicals. In this work, a new technology via the three-phase three-dimensional electro-Fenton reaction was employed for the first time to convert lignin or its derived aromatics. The operating parameters were optimized by central composite design, which was controlled to prompt the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids from lignin instead of degrading lignin to CO2. Under the optimized condition, the yields of palmitic acid and octadecanoic acid from lignin reached 138.41 and 112.31 mg/g, respectively. Key intermediators were identified during the electrolysis of lignin model compound using gas chromatography–quantitative time of flight mass spectrometry. The mechanism for the production of long-chain fatty acids from lignin was proposed. Lignin successively underwent degradation, opening ring, and couple reactions and produced free radicals. This study is the first to report the conversion of lignin into the precursor of biodiesel or advanced biofuels through electro-Fenton electrolysis at room temperature and atmosphere pressure. This study provides an environment-friendly route for direct conversion of lignin into high-value added products as a new strategy to valorize this undervalued component in lignocellulosic biomass. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The current study investigates the methanolysis reaction to increase biodiesel yield using the recently developed NaOH/magnetized ZIF-8 catalyst. The effects of methanol to oil ratio and catalyst dose on oil conversion with their interaction were studied by employing full factorial design and response surface methodology. Two-factor interaction model was selected as the best model to fit the experimental data with a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.97 where all the model's parameters were significant. The two factors were found positively influencing the reaction conversion. The maximum observed conversion reached almost 100% at 21:1 M methanol to oil ratio and 3 wt% catalyst/oil ratio. Additionally, the kinetic study revealed that pseudo-second order kinetic model fits the experimental data well. In addition, the Arrhenius equation analysis showed lower activation energy and higher pre-exponential factor for methanolysis in comparison with ethanolysis indicating the faster kinetics. Besides, ASTM standard testing techniques confirmed that the produced esters at optimum conditions can be used as biodiesel sustainable fuel. Finally, several modifications in the catalyst preparation conditions or procedure showed their ability to increase catalyst stability and reusability characteristics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The corn stover originated biochar was developed to catalyze and simplify the compositions of biocrude oil from cellulose pyrolysis. The generation of common species such as furans and (anhydro)-sugars in the biocrude oil from cellulose pyrolysis was weakened remarkably in the presence of biochars, while the formation of phenol and alkylphenols was enhanced. The formation of hydrogen was favored when the biochar was presented. For example at the temperature of 600 °C and biochar to cellulose ratio of 3, about 78 vol% of hydrogen was detected, increased from around 48 vol% for non-catalytic pyrolysis. Despite 10 cycles of reuse, the biochar remained a good activity towards promoting the generation of hydrogen and monomeric phenols. This work relates to a new access to simplify the compositions of biocrude oil and produce renewable hydrogen energy through the low-cost, simple, and highly stable biochar catalyst. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rhizopus oryzae lipase immobilised onto differently functionalised polymethacrylate (Purolite®) and magnetite superparamagnetic supports was assessed as a catalyst for biodiesel production with pomace oil. The presence of surface hydrocarbon chains increased the operational stability of the biocatalysts supported on Purolite® and superparamagnetic particles up to 9 and 2 times, respectively. By contrast, the presence of functional groups had no effect on the initial transesterification rate, which was twice higher with the lipase immobilised onto Purolite®. Also, functionalising Purolite® with epoxide and octadecyl groups led to the highest biodiesel and volumetric productivity. This biocatalyst with other substrates including makauba, jatropha, waste cooking oil, and microbial oil, led to similar initial reaction rates. However, simply raising substrate acidity from 0.5 to 2% increased the operational stability of the biocatalysts 15 times. A synergistic effect between acyl-acceptor concentration and substrate acidity was observed. The transesterification reaction was successfully scaled up to 50 mL. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Bioenergy crops provide enormous renewable biomass resources convertible for biofuel production, but lignocellulose recalcitrance fundamentally determines its enzymatic saccharification at high cost and low efficiency. In this study, total 30 diverse Miscanthus lignocellulose substrates were incubated with T. reesei strain to secret lignocellulose-degradation enzymes, and their major wall polymers features (cellulose crystallinity, hemicellulose arabinose and lignin H-monomer) were meanwhile examined with distinct impacts on the enzyme activities. Using characteristic Miscanthus (Msi62) de-lignin residue as inducing substrate with the reesei strain, this study detected that the Msi62-induced enzymes were of consistently higher enhancements on enzymatic saccharification of various lignocellulose residues examined in 17 grassy and woody bioenergy crops, particularly for the hemicellulose hydrolyses, compared to other two reesei-secreted cellulases and three commercial enzymes. Notably, based on SDS-gel protein separation profiling and LC-MS/MS analysis, the Msi62-induced enzymes consist of distinct cellulases (CBHI, BG, EGII) compositions and high-activity xylanases. Therefore, this study has demonstrated an applicable approach to achieve the optimal cellulases and xylanases cocktails that enable for low-costly and high-efficient enzymatic saccharification of diverse lignocellulose sources, providing a potential strategy for large-scale biofuel production in all major bioenergy crops. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work evaluates the bio-waste valorization approach for catalyst development, the use of products derived from biomass as raw material and the production of biofuels. In this research activated carbons were synthesized from orange peel using different synthesis conditions. With the activated carbons obtained with the best structure and texture, PtIr bimetallic catalysts were prepared. Carbon activation was carried out through a chemical process with phosphoric acid as an activating agent, varying acid concentration, substrate/activating agent ratio and time of contact between them. The best support was obtained using carbonization time of 1 h, carbonization temperature of 470 °C, phosphoric acid concentration of 50 wt % and with BET area of 1429 m2/g. Subsequently, the metallic nanoparticles were deposited in the activated carbon to use the solid as a catalytic material for the hydrogenation of HMF to 2,5-DMF. The catalyst showed excellent performance for the generation of biofuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crambe abyssinica is a non-edible crop able to adapt to adverse climatic conditions, arising as an alternative feedstock for biodiesel production. With this objective, an eco-friendly route for biodiesel production from crambe oil by enzymatic transesterification was evaluated in order to maximize fatty acid methyl esters content. Response Surface Methodology and central composite design (two factors, three levels, one central point, two replicas) was used to obtain predictive models considering catalyst concentration and methanol:oil molar ratio as independent variables. Since the reaction was monitored overtime, a predictive model considering three independent variables (three factors, three levels) was also obtained. Enzymatic transesterification is a good alternative process to obtain high FAME yield, with 84 ± 5 wt % being obtained after 2 h using a methanol:oil molar ratio 6:1 and 8 wt% of enzyme, a value which predictably can increase to almost 99 wt% after 24 h. The results showed that the methanol:oil molar ratio and the enzyme's concentration considerably influence the FAME content during enzymatic catalyzed reaction. The polynomial regression models obtained can help to balance the concentration of enzyme and alcohol to improve FAME production and to predict the resulting yield. © 2021

AB  - Soybean residue (SR) is a main solid waste produced during the extraction of soybean oil with bulk volume. In addition to the use as vegetable protein feed, SR could also be used as feedstock for producing biofuels and carbon materials via pyrolysis. In this study, the pyrolysis behaviors of SR at varied temperatures and heating rates were investigated. The results show that the pyrolysis of the organic components in SR could reach completion even at 500 °C, due to the lower thermal stability of the organic component than that in the typical biomass. This also leads to the bio-oil with little heavy organics and also low carbon content of the resulting biochar, as the organic components decomposed to a significant extent while the charring reactions were insignificant. This leads to the biochar with low heating value and low energy yield when compared with that in the pyrolysis of typical biomass. In addition, the high content of proteins, amino acids and other nitrogen-containing nutrients make the SR derived bio-oil nitrogen-rich and a significant portion of nitrogen could also be retained in the biochar. These specialties have to be considered during their applications as either biofuels or functional carbon materials. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Syngas from gasification of waste biomass is a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and hydrogen (H2), which can be utilized for the synthesis of biofuels such as methane (CH4). The aim of the study research work was to demonstrate how syngas could be methanated and upgraded to natural gas quality (biomethane) in a fed-batch trickle-bed reactor system using either manure – (AD-M) or sludge-based (AD-WW) inoculum as microbial basis. The methanated syngas had a high concentration of CO2 and did not fulfil the criteria for natural gas quality biomethane. Further upgrading of syngas to biomethane could be achieved simultaneously in the same reactors by addition of exogenous H2, resulting in CH4 concentrations up to 91.0 ± 3.5% (AD-WW) and 95.3 ± 1.0% (AD-M). Microbial analysis indicated that the communities differed between AD-M and AD-WW demonstrating functional redundancy among the microbial communities of different inocula. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Sustainable liquid fuel production from bio-oil compounds has attracted considerable attention in recent years. The catalytic etherification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) is an effective approach for the production of liquid fuels. However, the development of high-performance and chemically stable catalysts has remained challenging. In this work, ultra-small Pd-Ru NPs were successfully immobilized on the surfaces of 2D MXene nanosheets (Pd-Ru/MXene) via fish sperm DNA-assisted microwave process. HR-TEM imaging results with SAED analysis showed that the hexagonal closed-pack (hcp) Pd-Ru NPs were grown on the surfaces of sheet-like MXene, thus enhancing the specific surface area of 117 m2 g−1 and providing a higher density of the acid-base sites. Furthermore, Pd-Ru/MXene was employed for the etherification of HMF into EMF. The results showed that the Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst exhibited 98% EMF yield and 100% HMF conversion with the prolonged usage of catalyst for five consecutive reuse cycles. Additionally, fructose was directly converted into EMF with a higher yield of 82% over the Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst at lower reaction conditions. The recyclability test of the used Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst demonstrated its chemical stability under prolonged usage for several hours and is therefore suitable for commercial renewable liquid fuel production. Novelty Statement: The catalytic transformation of biomass into diesel-miscible biofuel is a sustainable route for liquid fuel production and has recently attracted massive attention. The chemically stable and high-performance Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst was successfully prepared and characterized. The study demonstrated that the Pd-Ru/MXene catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity toward the direct conversion of fructose and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) into 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (5-EMF), which is a promising conversion method for the production of biofuels from biomass. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - A new type of solid catalyst prepared from hydrothermal reaction of natural diatomaceous earth in NaOH solution was studied for biodiesel production through the transesterification of soybean and palm oil in excess methanol. Explicitly, the natural diatomite was transformed into efficacious catalysts, sequentially, by dispersion and activation in NaOH solutions for 30 min at 30 °C, followed by hydrothermal treatments at 180 °C or 220 °C for 12 h, and finally by calcination at 500 °C for 6 h. Coincidently, the physicochemical characteristics of these as-prepared catalysts were shown to bear a good resemblance with those of zeolite CAN. Under suitable conditions, the conversion efficiencies of soybean and palm oils to biodiesel in presence of these zeolite CAN catalysts at 63 °C and 70 °C could be obtained as high as 98.0% and 98.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the activation energies of the transesterification reactions of soybean and palm oils in excess methanol were found as 64.1 kJ/mol and 122.5 kJ/mol, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) is the preferred and promising method used worldwide to manage specific wastes and waste biomass. The techniques to maximize biogas productions by anaerobic digestion is explicitly introduced to achieve potential reactor operations. An essential consideration for combining anaerobic digestion with biochar is formed from waste biomass by thermochemical conversion. The latest enhancement work is showing the potential biochar results of augmentation of certain chemicals such as biofuels and charcoal, bioethanol, biodiesel, butanol, hydrogen, carboxylic acids, and hydrocarbons. However, there is still a lack of a detailed and robust interpretation of BC and AD relations. This article aims for systematic reviews on anaerobic digestion efficacy with the use of biochar. The maximum methane generation using biochar with enhanced AD efficiency ranges from 650 to 900 mL/d, with organic removal efficiencies varying from 70% to 75%. The major components of the biochar usage include hydrolysis, acidogenesis-acetogenesis, and the progression and equilibrium of methanogenesis are reviewed. Biochar properties provide reasonable conditions for pH adjusting, disinfectant, complementary sourcing, electron carrier servers, and the expression of physicochemical weights on an organism through various bacterial communities. Biochar can improve biomethane yield plans for the most part by chemically moving organisms, methanogen for biomethane yield, growth of microbial groups, and a stimulus for buffer potential. This article is giving an in-depth discussion of current advances, distinctive difficulties, and limitations of biochar applications in anaerobic digestion. Future research can focus on biochar's functions in acid buffering, acid reduction, and increasing syntropy between hydrolysis and acidogenesis-acetogenesis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work aimed to study the hydrolysis of ionic liquid (IL) pretreated sugarcane tops (SCT) biomass with in-house developed IL-stable enzyme preparation, from a fungal isolate Aspergillus flavus PN3. Maximum reducing sugar yield (181.18 mg/g biomass) was obtained from tris (2-hydroxyethyl) methylammonium-methylsulfate ([TMA]MeSO4) pretreated biomass. Pretreatment parameters were optimized to attain enhanced sugar yield (1.57-fold). Functional mechanism of IL mediated pretreatment of SCT biomass was elucidated by SEM, XRD, FTIR and 1H NMR studies. Furthermore, nanobiocatalysts prepared by immobilization of enzyme preparation by covalent coupling on magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with amino-propyl triethoxysilane, were assessed for their hydrolytic efficacy and reusability. Nanobiocatalysts were examined by SEM and FTIR analysis for substantiation of immobilization. This is the first ever report of application of magnetic nanobiocatalysts for saccharification of IL-pretreated sugarcane tops biomass. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A highly reactive acid-functionalized polymer is prepared by the simple condensation of aqueous formaldehyde and p-phenolsulfonic acid and used as a solid catalyst in concerted (trans)esterification. This yields biodiesel from Jatropha oil without the need to remove water by-product from the reaction mixture. An isolated biodiesel yield of 98 ± 2% is achieved using a catalyst loading of 10 wt %, methanol:oil ratio of 12:1, temperature of 90 °C, and reaction time of 6 h. The high activity of our catalyst is attributed to its porous nature and the co-inclusion of reactive SO3H sites and phenolic OH groups. Advantageously, these groups are hydrophilic, allowing the catalyst to remain highly active in the presence of H2O. Nine methyl ester components are identified in the biodiesel product, with 9-octadecanoic acid methyl ester (C18:2, 64.92%) and hexadecanoic acid methyl ester (C16:0, 16.44%) as the major constituents. The catalyst is evaluated over 4 cycles, maintaining a 92 ± 2% isolated yield. Physicochemical analysis of the spent catalyst by SEM-EDX suggests this decrease is due to some loss of mesoporosity and sulfur content. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, biofuels have been attracting more attention, especially in Europe, due to the new regulations concerning the improvement of renewables in fuel composition. The acid-catalysed alcoholysis reaction of the cellulosic fraction of raw and pre-treated lignocellulosic biomasses, using n-Butanol (n-BuOH) and diluted inorganic acid as homogeneous catalyst, produces a mixture mainly composed by Butyl Levulinate (BL) from cellulose, Dibutyl ether (DBE) from n-BuOH etherification and unreacted n-BuOH. This last can be then separated and recycled, so increasing the sustainability of the whole process. BL is directly obtained from cellulosic fraction of not edible biomass and represents a promising advanced biofuel. Therefore, in the different types of blends containing the main products obtainable from the one-pot alcoholysis of lignocellulosic biomasses, BL represents the effective renewable component of the fuel. In this work, different blends of BL/DBE mixed with Diesel fuel were tested in a small single-cylinder air-cooled Diesel engine with direct injection. Data concerning the measurement of pollutant emission, engine performance and combustion characteristics are reported. Results have been compared with those obtained fuelling the engine with a conventional Diesel fuel. The mixtures were prepared by using commercial reactants, characterized by compositions analogous to those of the reaction mixtures. The obtained results evidenced the potentiality of these novel blending mixtures to reduce the emissions of particulate without any increasing of NOx emission or changing in engine power and efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this present study, hydro-deoxygenation (HDO) process was performed to upgrade the liquefied bio-oil of Nostoc punctriforme biomass. The engine performance and emission properties of the enriched bio-oil and blends (with diesel) were evaluated. The HTL resulted in highest bio-oil yield of 47.5 wt% at a temperature of 300 °C at 60 min with calorific value of 32.5 MJ/kg. At 60 min and temperature of 300 °C with 1 wt% of heterogeneous catalyst the upgraded HDO-bio-oil yield reached 38.4 wt% with deoxygenation percentage of 70%. The properties of upgraded bio-oil are HHV of 44.74 MJ/kg, Kinematic viscosity of 6.23 mm2/s and density 923 kg/m3 respectively. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used for modeling and optimizing the upgraded bio-oil yield. The optimized RSM conditions for upgraded bio-oil yield (44.5 wt%) are temperature of 280 °C, catalyst load of 0.6 wt%, and time of 120 min. The physiochemical properties of upgraded bio-oil are in agreement with ASTM standards. Equal proportion of bio-oil to diesel (D50: B50) reduced the brake thermal efficiency to 6.66% with reduced NOx emission and slight increase in CO emission. This study highlights that microalga fuels are better renewable energy resource with reduced greenhouse gas emission. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Abstract: Microbial lipase from Burkholderia cepacia was immobilized by covalent bond and physical adsorption on SBA-15 mesoporous support and its catalytic efficiency was measured in the formation of fatty acids ethyl esters from palm kernel oil. The immobilized biocatalyst and its support were characterized by X-ray Diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, N2 Adsorption–desorption, and thermal analysis TG/DTG. The immobilization of the enzyme onto the support maintained the typical structure of the SBA-15. From the TG measurements, it can be deduced that about 25% of lipase was immobilized in SBA-15 via covalent bond and 15% was incorporated via physical adsorption. Both immobilized lipase preparations were used to perform the transesterification reactions using different oil: ethanol molar ratios and time. The biocatalyst prepared by physical adsorption promoted better results, measured by the apparent yield (&gt; 90%) and conversion (98.9%) in all reactions, which were also confirmed by viscosity and density data. The regeneration of SBA-15 support was found to be feasible and demonstrated efficiency for 5 times, reducing the associated costs of the process.

AB  - The energy demand of the world is skyrocketing due to the exponential economic growth and population expansion. To meet the energy requirement, the use of fossil fuels is not a good decision, causing environmental pollution such as CO2 emissions. Therefore, the use of renewable energy sources like biofuels can meet the energy crisis especially for countries facing oil shortages such as Pakistan. This review describes the comparative study of biodiesel synthesis for various edible oils, non-edible oils, and wastes such as waste plastic oil, biomass pyrolysis oil, and tyre pyrolysis oil in terms of their oil content and extraction, cetane number, and energy content. The present study also described the importance of biodiesel synthesis via catalytic transesterification and its implementation in Pakistan. Pakistan is importing an extensive quantity of cooking oil that is used in the food processing industries, and as a result, a huge quantity of waste cooking oil (WCO) is generated. The potential waste oils for biodiesel synthesis are chicken fat, dairy scum, WCO, and tallow oil that can be used as potential substrates of biodiesel. The implementation of a biodiesel program as a replacement of conventional diesel will help to minimize the oil imports and uplift the country's economy. Biodiesel production via homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyzed transesterification is more feasible among all transesterification processes due to a lesser energy requirement and low cost. Therefore, biodiesel synthesis and implementation could minimize the imports of diesel by significantly contributing to the overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Although, waste oil can meet the energy needs, more available cultivation land should be used for substrate cultivation. In addition, research is still needed to explore innovative solvents and catalysts so that overall biodiesel production cost can be minimized. This would result in successful biodiesel implementation in Pakistan. © 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.

AB  - Conversion of lignocellulosic residue to bioenergy and biofuel is a promising platform for global sustainability. Fractionation is an initial step for isolating lignocellulosic components for subsequent valorization. The aim of this research is to develop the solvothermal fractionation of sugarcane bagasse to produce high purity lignin. The physio-chemical structure of isolated lignin from this process was determined. In this study, a central composite design-based response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize an acid promoter for isolating lignin from sugarcane bagasse using a solvothermal fractionation process. The reaction was carried out with sulfuric acid, at a concentration of 0.01-0.02 M and a reaction temperature of 180-200 °C for 30-90 min. The optimal conditions for the experiment were obtained at the acid concentration of 0.02 M with a temperature of 200 °C for 90 min in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK)/methanol/water (35% : 25% : 40% v/v%). The results showed that 88% of lignin removal was done in the solid phase, while 87% of lignin recovery was conducted in the organic phase. Furthermore, the changes in the physico-chemical characteristics of solid residue and lignin recovery were analyzed using various techniques. GPC analysis of recovered lignin from the organic fraction showed a lowerMw(1374 g mol−1) and polydispersity index (1.75) compared to commercial organosolv lignin. The major lignin degradation temperature of commercial organosolv lignin was estimated to be 410 °C, whereas BGL showed two main degradations at 291 °C and 437 °C, which could point to potential relationships with the degradation of β-O-4 cross-links. The results indicated that recovered lignin was mostly cross-linked by β-O-4 cross-links. In addition, Py-GC/MS and 2D HSQC NMR gave more information regarding the compositional and structural features of recovered lignin. The development of the sulfuric acid catalyzed solvothermal process in this study provides efficient extraction of high-value organosolv lignin from sugarcane bagasse and the production of recovered lignin in the organic phase with low contamination from other contents. The lignin characteristic data can contribute to the development of lignin valorization in value-added applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Transition to a new energy low carbon pool requires the gradual replacing of fossil fuels with other cleaner energies and biofuels. In this work, the environmental impact of renewable diesel production using an attributional life cycle assessment was evaluated by considering five stages: palm plantation-culture-harvest, palm oil extraction, palm oil refining, green (renewable) diesel production, and biofuel use. The functional unit was established as 1.6 × 10−2 m3 (13.13 kg) of renewable diesel. The results show that the production of renewable diesel by Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids is more environmentally friendly than fossil diesel production. In particular, the analysis showed that the CO2 emission decreases around 110% (i.e. mitigation occurred) compared with conventional diesel production. However, renewable diesel production has a relevant environmental impact in the human toxicity category due to the high consumption of agrochemicals during palm culture. © Copyright © 2021 Arguelles-Arguelles, Amezcua-Allieri and Ramírez-Verduzco.

AB  - Producing renewable biofuels from biomass is a promising way to meet future energy demand. Here, we demonstrated a lignin to diesel route via dimerization of the lignin oil followed by hydrodeoxygenation. The lignin oil undergoes C−C bond dehydrogenative coupling over Au/CdS photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, co-generating diesel precursors and hydrogen. The Au nanoparticles loaded on CdS can effectively restrain the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus improving the efficiency of the dimerization reaction. About 2.4 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 dimers and 1.6 mmol gcatal−1 h−1 H2 were generated over Au/CdS, which is about 12 and 6.5 times over CdS, respectively. The diesel precursors are finally converted into C16–C18 cycloalkanes or aromatics via hydrodeoxygenation reaction using Pd/C or porous CoMoS catalyst, respectively. The conversion of pine sawdust to diesel was performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the lignin-to-diesel route. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) under psychrophilic temperature has only recently garnered deserved attention. In major parts of Europe, USA, Canada and Australia, climatic conditions are more suited for psychrophilic (<20 ℃) rather than mesophilic (35 – 37 ℃) and thermophilic (55 – 60 ℃) AD. Low temperature has adverse effects on important cellular processes which may render the cell biology inactive. Moreover, cold climate can also alter the physical and chemical properties of wastewater, thereby reducing the availability of substrate to microbes. Hence, the use of low temperature acclimated microbial biomass could overcome thermodynamic constraints and carry out flexible structural and conformational changes to proteins, membrane lipid composition, expression of cold-adapted enzymes through genotypic and phenotypic variations. Reduction in organic loading rate is beneficial to methane production under low temperatures. Moreover, modification in the design of existing reactors and the use of hybrid reactors have already demonstrated improved methane generation in the lab-scale. This review also discusses some novel strategies such as direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), co-digestion of substrate, bioaugmentation, and bioelectrochemical system assisted AD which present promising prospects. While DIET can facilitate syntrophic electron exchange in diverse microbes, the addition of organic-rich co-substrate can help in maintaining suitable C/N ratio in the anaerobic digester which subsequently can enhance methane generation. Bioaugmentation with psychrophilic strains could reduce start-up time and ensure daily stable performance for wastewater treatment facilities at low temperatures. In addition to the technical discussion, the economic assessment and future outlook on psychrophilic AD are also highlighted. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass pyrolysis and the in-line catalytic cracking of the pyrolysis volatile stream has been approached in this study. The pyrolysis step was carried out in a conical spouted bed reactor at 500 °C, whereas the inert sand or the cracking catalysts (γ-Al2O3, spent FCC and olivine) were placed in a fixed bed reactor at 600 °C. Product analysis was carried out on-line by means of chromatographic methods, and the distribution and composition of the main products obtained have been related to the features characterizing each catalyst (physical properties, chemical composition and acidity). Decarbonylation reactions were favoured over decarboxylation ones when acid catalysts (spent FCC and γ-Al2O3) were used, whereas olivine promoted ketonization and aldol condensation reactions. The Fe species in the olivine structure enhanced reforming and WGS reactions. Bio-oil cracking was more severe as catalyst acidity was increased, leading to an increase in the hydrocarbon fraction. The Al2O3 derived bio-oil was substantially deoxygenated, with a considerable reduction in the phenolic fraction, which accounted mainly for alkyl-phenols. The three materials tested led to a significant decrease in acid and phenolic compounds in the volatile stream, making it suitable for further catalytic valorization for the production of H2, fuels and chemicals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The concept of biorefinery still requires advancements in process development for energy and materials. Ionic liquids have been successfully used for several biorefinery applications including high yield synthesis of biofuels and value added platform chemicals. Designing suitable ionic liquid that is efficient in terms of cost as well as product selectivity is still highly needed. This study is carried out to check the effect of different anions of Bronsted acidic ionic liquids (BAILs), Bronsted Lewis acidic ionic liquids (BLAILs), Lewis acidic ionic liquids (LAILs) as well as organic electrolyte solutions (OES) for 5-HMF selectivities from monosaccharides, polysaccharides as well as lignocellulosic composite. Different variables and parameters such as Lewis acidity of anions, alkyl side chain of ionic liquid, metal chloride type and loading, time, temperature, substrate loading, polar protic and aprotic solvents are thoroughly studied for process optimization. Polar protic solvents added in [C1C4SO3HPy] based ionic liquids with CH3COO− and Cl− anions yielded 94 and 80% 5-HMF from fructose and glucose respectively in the presence of AlCl3 as Lewis acid. C4SO3H side chain yielding high from fructose and glucose is inefficient for conversion of cellulose and lignocellulose. High product selectivity from these biopolymers is achieved using butyl side chain with 3-methylpyridinium cation and chlorochromate anion. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuel may be an important component of aviation fuel for its significant advantages. In the present work, two biofuel samples, methyl laurate and pinane, are selected for blending research withn-dodecane, a typical model fuel of aviation kerosene. Densities and viscosities for the ternary system pinane (1) +n-dodecane (2) + methyl laurate (3) and corresponding binary systems have been measured at the temperatures from 293.15 to 333.15 K and atmospheric pressure. The excess molar volume (VmE) and viscosity deviation (Δη) of binary systems have been calculated based on experimental data and fitted to the Redlich-Kister equation, while those of the ternary system have been fitted to Nagata-Tamura, Redlich-Kister, Cibulka, and Singh semiempirical equations, respectively. The values of the excess molar volume are all positive for all investigated systems, while the viscosity deviations are all negative. The results are discussed from the perspective of intermolecular force and the structure. Furthermore, the densities and viscosities of both binary and ternary mixtures are satisfactorily correlated using the Jouyban-Acree model. © 2021 American Chemical Society

AB  - Nanosized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) have been employed as molecular weight enlarged structures for different purposes owing to their ease of synthesis and modification. In this work, the commercially available compound octaphenyl-POSS has been modified with chlorosulfonic acid to obtain multifunctional acidic materials (H-Sulfo-POSS) with different degrees of functionality in the structure. The synthesized materials have been characterized by ion exchange capacity, degree of sulfonation,1H-NMR, ATR-IR spectroscopy and SEM. These H-Sulfo-POSS nanocomposites were then applied to the acetalization of glycerol with 2-butanone to yield the corresponding ketal, which is a product of interest as an oxygenate fuel additive. The catalytic activity in dynamic experiments of the H-Sulfo-POSS (2601 h−1) material with the highest degree of sulfonation was even higher than that shown by the molecular catalystpara-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA) (2256 h−1) and better than Amberlyst 36 (213 h−1); however, upon recycling by centrifugation of the catalyst, the activity of this material was not very stable. On the other hand, the material with the lowest degree of sulfonation showed not only higher activity than Amberlyst 36, but also very stable activity after reutilization throughout 10 runs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), one of the effective approaches of C-O bond scission, plays a crucial role in biomass-derived oxygenate conversion to high value-added chemicals and biofuels. Herein, we systematically investigated the HDO reaction of furfural (FAL) to 2-methylfuran (2-MF) over 17 kinds of Ni-based bimetallic catalysts based on periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Ni-based partner (3d and 4d metals) has an important influence on the catalytic performance toward the FAL HDO reaction, which modifies the Ni electronic environment and induces the bimetal d orbital overlap, giving rise to changes in adsorption configuration and reaction activity. A specific correlation between the oxygen binding energy (OBE) value and energy barrier of C-OH scission/*OH species hydrogenation suggests that OBE serves as the most appropriate descriptor to characterize the activity of bimetallic catalysts. Due to the competitive relationship between C-O scission and *OH species hydrogenation, a trade-off of OBE has been built to promote C-O scission and hydrogenation activity simultaneously, in which Ni-M (M = Fe, Co, Mo, or Ru) bimetallic catalysts show prominent catalytic performance. Besides, we revealed that this descriptor can be extended to other bimetallic catalysts (CoV, CoFe, CuCo). Based on the calculation prediction, we prepared several alloys (NiCu, NiCo and NiZr). A series of characterization techniques (HRTEM, EDS, XPS, H2-TPR) indicated the formation of the alloys, whose catalytic evaluations verify that Ni-based catalysts (e.g., NiCo) with a compromise OBE value (from −4.00 to −2.00 eV) exhibit enhanced catalytic behavior towards FAL HDO to 2-MF, superior to other ones (e.g., NiCu: OBE value &gt; −2.00 eV; NiZr: OBE value &lt; −4.00 eV). This work offers a feasible strategy to design bimetallic catalysts for the HDO reaction based on the electronic environment and chemical nature of doped metals. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - This study focuses on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in fuel generation and assesses the potential of biofuel generation to decarbonise the fuel economy by reducing CO2emissions to the atmosphere. The research investigates the technical, economic, and environmental performances of three biofuel production routes, namely Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), bio-synthetic natural gas (bioSNG) and oxymethylene ethers (OMEx) synthesis using flowsheets developed in Aspen Plus. It constitutes the first attempt to holistically evaluate both the techno-economic performance and the environmental benefits of employing BECCS in fuel generation. For an input of 1020 dry tonnes per day of woody biomass, the FTS route yields 275 t d−1, the bioSNG route yields 238 t d−1and the OMExroute yields 635 t d−1of fuel and the energy efficiency is in the range of 44.9% to59.7% without CCS and 44.0% to 58.2% with CCS. In addition, negative emissions can be achieved for all routes with CCS in the range of 301 000 to 519 000 tCO2per year. For economic viability, the minimum selling price for FT-fuels, bioSNG, and OMExproduction with CCS have been calculated as £23.4 per GJ, £14.5 per GJ and £26.5 per GJ, respectively. However, competition with conventional fossil-derived fuels is not possible without the combination of existing financial incentives and a proposed carbon pricing. With carbon credit as the only financial incentive, carbon pricing in the range of £48 to £86 per tCO2needs to be applied to achieve feasibility. Also, more negative emissions need to be generated to decrease the value of this range and reasonably phase out dependence on fossil-derived fuels. Parametric studies identified as crucial parameters to be improved the fuel output, CAPEX, operating hours and feedstock cost. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Sulfides of NiMo over a series of commercial ultra-stable Y zeolites were studied in an autoclave reactor to elucidate the effect of silica/alumina ratio (SAR = 12, 30, and 80) on the cleavage of etheric C-O (β-O-4) and C-C (both sp3-sp2and sp2-sp2) linkages present in native/technical lignin and lignin derived bio-oils. 2-Phenethyl phenyl ether (PPE), 4,4-dihydroxydiphenylmethane (DHDPM), and 2-phenylphenol, (2PP) were examined as model dimers at 345 °C and 50 bar of total pressure using dodecane as the solvent. The etheric C-O hydrogenolysis activity was found to be in the order NiMoY30 &gt; NiMoY12 &gt; NiMoY80, despite a high initial rate of C-O cleavage over NiMoY12 owing to its high acid density. A high degree of hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and hydrocracking reactions were observed with NiMoY30 yielding &gt;80% of deoxygenated products of which ∼58% are benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzenes. A similar experiment with DHDPM showed the rapid cleavage of the methylene-linked C-C dimer (sp3-sp2) to phenols and cresols even with the low acid density (high SAR) catalyst, NiMoY80. Direct hydrocracking of the recalcitrant 5-5′ linkage in 2PP is very slow, however, it cleavedviaa cascade of HDO, ring-hydrogenation, and hydrocracking reactions. A high degree of hydrogenolysis and hydrocracking occurs over NiMoY30 due to suitable balance between acidity and pore accessibility, enhanced proximity between acidic and deoxygenation sites leading to a slightly higher dispersion of Ni promoted MoS2crystallites. Overall, the product spectrum consisted of a high yield of deoxygenated products. The carbon content on the recovered catalyst was in the range of 3-7 wt%. These results pave the way for effective catalysts to break recalcitrant linkages present in lignin to obtain a hydrocarbon-rich liquid transportation fuel. An experiment with Kraft lignin over NiMoY30 shows good selectivity for deoxygenated aromatics and cycloalkanes in the liquid phase. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) are sustainable biofuel that can alleviate high oil costs and environmental impacts of petroleum-based fuel. A modified 1200 W high-efficiency food blender was employed for continuous transesterification of various refined vegetable oils and waste cooking oil (WCO) using sodium hydroxide as a homogeneous catalyst. The following factors have been investigated on their effects on FAME yield: baffles, reaction volume, total reactant flow rate, methanol-oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration and reaction temperature. Results indicated that the optimal conditions were: 2000 mL reaction volume, 50 mL/min total flow rate, 1% and 1.25% catalyst concentration for refined palm oil and WCO, respectively, 6:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio and 62-63 °C, obtaining yield efficiency over 96.5% FAME yield of 21.14 × 10-4 g/J (for palm oil) and 19.39 × 10-4 g/J (for WCO). All the properties of produced FAMEs meet the EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards. The modified household food blender could be a practical and low-cost alternative biodiesel production apparatus for continuous biodiesel production for small communities in remote areas.

AB  - Methanolysis of vegetable oils in the presence of homogeneous catalysts remains the most important process for producing biodiesel. However, there is still a lack of accurate description of the reaction kinetics. This is in part due to the complexity of the reacting system in which a large number of interconnected reactions take place simultaneously. In this work, attention is focused on the biphasic character of the reaction medium, formed by two immiscible liquid phases. The behavior of the phases is investigated regarding their physicochemical properties, mainly density and mutual solubility of the components, as well as composition. In addition, two kinetic models with different level of complexity regarding the biphasic character of the reaction medium have been developed. It has been found that a heterogeneous model considering the presence of the two phases and the distribution of the several compounds between them is indispensable to get a good description of the process in terms of oil conversion and products yields. The model captures the effects of the main variables of an isothermal batch methanolysis process: methanol/oil molar ratio, reaction time and catalyst concentration. Nevertheless, some adjustment is still required as concerns modelling of the saponification reactions and catalyst deactivation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This research investigates the effects of a synthetic diesel-like fuel (Fischer-Tropsch diesel) and biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) fuel blends on the energy-exergy efficiencies and gaseous exhaust emissions characteristics of a compression ignition engine. Two blends of alternative fuels denoted as E15B35FTD50 (15% ethanol, 35% biodiesel, and 50% Fischer-Tropsch diesel) and E15B35D50 (15% ethanol, 35% biodiesel, and 50% diesel) were experimentally studied on a single-cylinder diesel engine and compared to diesel fuel. The results show that the energetic and the ex-ergetic efficiencies of the alternative fuels are comparable to those of the engine fueled with diesel fuel. The unburnt HC, NO, N2O, and NH3 emissions were reduced for the two alternative fuel blends compared to diesel, while CO emissions increased. The light HC species were found to slightly increase for the alternative fuel blends in comparison with diesel fuel. However, the total HC was considerably reduced by the combustion of E15B35FTD50 not only when compared to the diesel fuel combustion, but also when compared to E15B35D50. Overall, these results may contrib-ute to identifying advantages and limitations in terms of energetic-exergetic analysis and emissions for the new generation of conventional diesel and hybrid electric vehicles that aim to achieve future emissions regulations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Abstract: A platinum catalyst and a ruthenium catalyst were synthesized from a porousaromatic framework, namely PAF-30. The catalyst properties were examined inhydrogenation of phenol and guaiacol at 80–250°C and at a hydrogen pressure of30 atm in the presence of various solvents. Significant effects of the reactionmedium, process conditions, and catalyst morphology on the reaction mechanismwere demonstrated. Reaction conditions optimal for complete conversion of phenoland guaiacol to hydrogenation products were selected for both catalysts.

AB  - Alternative and sustainable waste sources are receiving increasing attention as they can be used to produce biofuels with a low carbon footprint. Waste fish oil is one such example and can be considered an abundant and sustainable waste source to produce biodiesel. Ultimately this could lead to fishing communities having their own ‘off-grid’ source of fuel for boats and vehicles. At the industrial level, biodiesel is currently produced by homogeneous catalysis because of the high catalyst activity and selectivity. In contrast, heterogeneous catalysis offers several advantages such as improved reusability, reduced waste and lower processing costs. Here we investigate the phase evolution of two heterogeneous catalysts, CaO and a Ca3Al2O6:CaO (‘C3A:CaO’) composite, under in-situ conditions for biodiesel production from fish oil. A new reactor was designed to monitor the evolution of the crystalline catalyst during the reaction using synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction. The amount of calcium diglyceroxide (CaDG) began to increase rapidly after approximately 30 min, for both catalysts. This rapid increase in CaDG could be linked to ex-situ nuclear magnetic resonance studies which showed that the conversion of fish oil to biodiesel rapidly increased after 30 min. The key to the difference in activity of the two catalysts appears to be that the Ca3Al2O6:CaO composite maintains a high rate of CaDG formation for longer than CaO, although the initial formation rates and reaction kinetics are similar. The Ca for the CaDG mainly comes from the CaO phase. In addition, towards the end of the second test utilising the CaO catalyst (after 120 min), there is a rapid decrease in CaDG and a rapid increase in Ca(OH)2. This was not observed for the Ca3Al2O6:CaO catalyst and this is due to Ca3Al2O6 stabilising the CaO in the composite material. No additional calcium containing intermediate crystalline phases were observed during our in-situ experiment. Overall this specialised in-situ set-up has been shown to be suitable to monitor the phase evolution of heterogeneous crystalline catalysts during the triglycerides transesterification reaction, offering the opportunity to correlate the crystalline phases to activity, deactivation and stability. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Redox catalysts, including hydrogenases, can be embedded into films made of redox polymers, whose side chains mediate electrons between the catalyst and an electrode. These films can be used as bioanodes in H2-based biofuel cells, because they protect the catalyst from O2-induced inactivation: self-protection occurs because a fraction of the incoming H2 is used in the outer region of the film to catalytically produce electrons that reduce the O2 molecules that penetrate the film. Here, we focus on the case of unidirectional catalysis (e. g. H2 oxidation) by an enzyme that is irreversibly inactivated by O2, embedded in a film of arbitrary thickness. We analytically solve the reaction/diffusion system to fully describe the time evolution of the penetration of O2 and we discuss the amount of H2 consumed by the protection mechanism. We establish the relations between film thickness, electron conduction, catalyst use and life time. This provides the theoretical framework required to optimize the design of these systems. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - In recent years, biofuels have been receiving significant attention because of their potential for decreasing carbon emissions and providing a long-term renewable solution to unsustainable fossil fuels. Currently, lactones are some of the alternatives being produced. Many lactones occur in a range of natural substances and have many advantages over bioethanol. In this study, the oxidation of alpha-angelica lactone initiated by ground-state atomic oxygen, O(3P), was studied at 298, 550, and 700 K using synchrotron radiation coupled with multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL). Photoionization spectra and kinetic time traces were measured to identify the primary products. Ketene, acetaldehyde, methyl vinyl ketone, methylglyoxal, dimethyl glyoxal, and 5-methyl-2,4-furandione were characterized as major reaction products, with ketene being the most abundant at all three temperatures. Possible reaction pathways for the formation of the observed primary products were computed using the CBS–QB3 composite method. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - One of the more promising technologies for future renewable fuel production from biomass is hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Although enormous progress in the context of continuous experiments on demonstration plants has been made in the last years, still many research questions concerning the understanding of the HTL reaction network remain unanswered. In this study, a unique process model of an HTL process chain has been developed in Aspen Plus® for three feedstock, microalgae, sewage sludge and wheat straw. A process chain consisting of HTL, hydrotreatment (HT) and catalytic hydrothermal gasification (cHTG) build the core process steps of the model, which uses 51 model compounds representing the hydrolysis products of the different biochemical groups lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, lignin, extractives and ash for modeling the biomass. Two extensive reaction networks of 272 and 290 reactions for the HTL and HT process step, respectively, lead to the intermediate biocrude (~200 model compounds) and the final upgraded biocrude product (~130 model compounds). The model can reproduce important characteristics, such as yields, elemental analyses, boiling point distribution, product fractions, density and higher heating values of experimental results from continuous experiments as well as literature values. The model can be applied as basis for techno-economic and environmental assessments of HTL fuel production, and may be further developed into a predictive yield modeling tool. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - As the environment is humiliated at a disturbing rate, most governments have persistent calls following global energy policies for the utilization of biofuels. This paper essentially examines the portrayal investigations of fatty acid methyl esters and fatty acid pentyl esters obtained from palm oil. The characterization studies such as gas chromatogram, mass spectrometry, and Fourier transformed infrared spectrometry have been performed to study biodiesel’s chemical composition. This article likewise shows biodiesel’s physiochemical properties and concentrates on biodiesel blends’ hypothetical combustion properties with Al2O3 nanoparticles. The spectroscopic investigations demonstrate the contiguity of eight methyl esters and five pentyl esters prevalently of palmitic acid, oleic acid, octanoic acid, and stearic acid. The esters’ nearness was additionally affirmed by the FTIR range, where the peaks in the scope of 1700 cm−1 to 1600 cm−1 can be observed. Looking at the thermophysical properties of the mixes with that of the base diesel fuel yielded the compromising results by giving the comparative density to that of the diesel fuel. The palm oil biodiesel’s calorific value is, by all accounts, diminished by 10% when contrasted with diesel fuel. The addition of the nanoparticles up to 1 g has raised the calorific value most closely to the diesel’s value. Correspondingly, the theoretical burning examinations have demonstrated the limit of biodiesel to go about as an option compared to consistent diesel in the conventional DI–CI engine. This article talks about the combustion attributes of the blend containing 60% diesel, 20% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), and 20% fatty acid pentyl ester (FAPE) with aluminium oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles at two distinctive concentrations. This article primarily concerns the inquiry of combustion criterion, such as in-chamber pressure variation, rate of heat release, start of combustion, end of combustion, and ignition delay for considered fuel blends when contrasted with neat diesel fuel in a four-stroke, direct-injection, single-cylinder diesel engine. The results showed a decrease in in-cylinder pressure at all loads of engine operation for biodiesel blends when compared with neat diesel, irrespective of the nanoparticle concentration. Biodiesel blends at all nanoparticle concentrations showed an increase in ignition delay compared with diesel fuels at all engine operation loads. The performance results show a slight deterioration in the engine’s thermal efficiency using biodiesel blends, irrespective of the nanoparticle concentration. Additionally, the emissions show a considerable fall in trends for all loads in contrast with diesel fuel. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) obtained from biomass is an important platform chemical for the next generation of plastics and biofuel production. Although industrialized, the high yield of HMF in aqueous systems was rarely achieved. The main problem is that HMF tends to form byproducts when co-adsorbed with water at acid sites. In this study, the pressure was reduced to improve the maximum yield of HMF from 9.3 to 35.2% (at 190◦ C in 60 min) in a glucose aqueous solution. The mechanism here involved water boiling as caused by pressure reduction, which in turn promoted the desorption of HMF from the solid catalyst, thereby inhibiting the side reaction of HMF. Furthermore, the solid catalysts could be reused three times without a significant loss of their catalytic activity. Overall, this work provides an effective strategy to improve the yield of HMF in water over heterogeneous catalysts in practice. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The use of lignocellulosic biomass to obtain biofuels and chemicals produces a large amount of lignin as a byproduct. Lignin valorization into chemicals needs efficient conversion processes to be developed. In this work, hydrocracking of organosolv lignin was performed by using nickel Raney catalyst. Organosolv lignin was obtained from the pretreatment of eucalyptus wood at 170◦C for 1 h by using 1/100/100 (w/v/v) ratio of biomass/oxalic acid solution (0.4% w/w)/1-butanol. The resulting organic phase of lignin in 1-butanol was used in hydrogenation tests. The conversion of lignin was carried out with a batch reactor equipped with a 0.3 L vessel with adjustable internal stirrer and heat control. The reactor was pressurized at 5 bar with hydrogen at room temperature, and then the temperature was raised to 250◦C and kept for 30 min. Operative conditions were optimized to achieve high conversion in monomers and to minimize the loss of solvent. At the best performance conditions, about 10 wt % of the lignin was solubilized into monomeric phenols. The need to find a trade-off between lignin conversion and solvent side reaction was highlighted. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This work investigates the effect of production scales (laboratory, bench, and pilot) by pyrolysis of Açaí (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) seeds at 450◦C and 1.0 atmosphere, on the yields of reaction products and acid value of bio-oils. The experiments were carried out in batch mode using a laboratory scale reactor of 143 mL, a bench scale reactor of 1.5 L, and a pilot scale reactor of 143 L (≈1:10:1000). The bio-oil was obtained in pilot scale, fractionated by distillation to produce biofuel-like fractions. The distillation of bio-oil was carried out in a laboratory column. The physical-chemistry properties (density, kinematic viscosity, acid value, and refractive index) of bio-oils and distillation fractions were determined. The qualitative analysis was determined by FT-IR and the chemical composition by GC-MS. The pyrolysis showed bio-oil yields from 4.37 to 13.09 (wt.%), decreasing with reactor volume. The acid value of bio-oils varied from 68.31 to 70.26 mg KOH/g. The distillation of bio-oil produced gasoline, light kerosene, and kerosene-like fuel fractions, and the yields were 16.16, 19.56, and 41.89 (wt.%), respectively. The physical-chemistry properties of distillation fractions increase with temperature. The FT-IR analysis of bio-oils and distillation fractions identified the presence of functional groups characteristic of hydrocarbons (alkenes, alkanes, aromatics, and aromatics rings) and oxygenates (carboxylic acids, ketones, esters, ethers, alcohols, phenols). The GC-MS identified 48.24 (area.%) hydrocarbons and 51.76 (area.%) oxygenates in the bio-oil produced in bench scale and 21.52 (area.%) hydrocarbons and 78.48 (area.%) oxygenates in the bio-oil produced in pilot scale. The gasoline-like fraction was composed by 64.0 (area.%) hydrocarbons and 36.0 (area.%) oxygenates, light kerosene-like fraction by 66.67 (area.%) hydrocarbons and 33.33 (area.%) oxygenates, and kerosene-like fraction by 19.87 (area.%) hydrocarbons and 81.13 (area.%) oxygenates. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - There are two types of cytochrome P450 enzymes in nature, namely, the monooxygenases and the peroxygenases. Both enzyme classes participate in substrate biodegradation or biosynthesis reactions in nature, but the P450 monooxygenases use dioxygen, while the peroxygenases take H2O2 in their catalytic cycle instead. By contrast to the P450 monooxygenases, the P450 peroxygenases do not require an external redox partner to deliver electrons during the catalytic cycle, and also no external proton source is needed. Therefore, they are fully self‐sufficient, which affords them opportunities in biotechnological applications. One specific P450 peroxygenase, namely, P450 OleTJE, reacts with long‐chain linear fatty acids through oxidative decarboxylation to form hydrocarbons and, as such, has been implicated as a suitable source for the biosynthesis of biofuels. Unfortunately, the reactions were shown to produce a considerable amount of side products originating from Cα and Cβ hydroxylation and desaturation. These product distributions were found to be strongly dependent on whether the substrate had substituents on the Cα and/or Cβ atoms. To understand the bifurcation pathways of substrate activation by P450 OleTJE leading to decarboxylation, Cα hydroxylation, Cβ hydroxylation and Cα-Cβ desaturation, we performed a computational study using 3‐phenylpropionate and 2‐phenylbutyrate as substrates. We set up large cluster models containing the heme, the substrate and the key features of the substrate binding pocket and calculated (using density functional theory) the pathways leading to the four possible products. This work predicts that the two substrates will react with different reaction rates due to accessibility differences of the substrates to the active oxidant, and, as a consequence, these two substrates will also generate different products. This work explains how the substrate binding pocket of P450 OleTJE guides a reaction to a chemoselectivity. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Oleoresin is obtained via tapping of pine trees and as a by-product of Kraft process in the pulp industry. Because of its low production cost, it is an attractive source for biofuels. Oleoresin is composed mainly of rosin (around 80%, a solid mixture of isomeric abietic acids), and it cannot be used directly as fuel in engines. However, the methyl ester of rosin has lower boiling and melting points than rosin, and it is highly soluble in hydrocarbons. Esterification of rosin with methyl alcohol was evaluated over acid and basic heterogeneous catalysts in the presence of several solvents. In contrast to acid catalysts, basic materials were active in the reaction. In particular, a low-cost calcium-based material showed the best performance. A 55% conversion of rosin with complete selectivity to methyl esters was obtained with 40% wt. loading of the calcium-based material (respect to rosin), under mild conditions (atmospheric pressure, 64 °C and 3.5 h) and without solvent. Other catalysts, such as magnesium oxide, titanium dioxide, and alumina, achieved up to 30% conversion. Calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide were the main phases in the calcium-based material, suggesting that the strength of basic sites can be an important property of the catalyst activity. A calcium-based material was used in five reaction cycles, obtaining a significant reduction in the activity attributed to the leaching of some phases of the catalyst. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of wastewater microalgae is constrained by the high ash content in the biomass. High ash content causes slagging, fouling, and catalyst deactivation. In this study, batch experiments for hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of filamentous algae were carried out in a 1.8-L autoclave reactor to measure the effects of reaction conditions and demineralization on the yields and quality of the products. Nitric acid was the most efficient demineralization acid, halving ash content (27.1 to 13.5 wt%). HTL of untreated algae showed that, as temperature increased from 310 to 350 °C, total bio-crude oil (light + heavy) yield slightly increased (25.4 to 28.0 wt%, dry ash-free). HTL of demineralized algae gave higher total bio-crude oil yields (27.2 to 43.4 wt%, dry ash-free), greater energy recovery (29.5 to 50.9%), higher char yields (22.1 to 32.5 wt%, dry ash-free), and decreased energy consumption ratios (from 1.0 to 0.6) compared to HTL of untreated algae. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of the feedstocks revealed slightly higher carbohydrate content in the acid-treated biomass compared to the untreated biomass. Both FT-IR and FT ion cyclotron resonance mass spectroscopy of the bio-crude oils showed no significant difference in the functional groups and heteroatoms in the hexane-soluble bio-crude oil derived from untreated and acid-treated biomass. These results demonstrate that demineralization of wastewater algae is relevant for improving the feasibility of algal wastewater-treatment-to-biofuel systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Succulent halophyte Salicornia sp. was characterized to evaluate its suitability for biorefinery, as soil salinization is seen as a major agricultural issue and the demand for biofuel is increasing. Green fractionation of biomass approach was chosen, with liquid and solid fractions of the biomass considered separately. Soxhlet extractions were used to separate different biochemical groups from the pulp, and the lignocellulosic residue was hydrothermally pretreated, enzymatically hydrolyzed, mixed with an existing agricultural feedstock, and fed to black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) for sugars-to-lipids conversion. The ASTM approved route of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) was applied using in silico study of processing BSFL lipids to sustainable jet fuel, using SuperPro Designer and Aspen HYSYS. Simulations and techno-economic assessment showed, with the applied process routes, inputs and production rates, the biorefinery process will be profitable in 7 years, with a biomass input flow rate of over 60 ton h−1 Salicornia sp. with decreasing payback time as the biomass input flow rate increases. Therefore, Salicornia sp. feedstock and sugars-to-lipids conversion method for biorefinery and liquid fuel production can function as a feasible biorefinery process with a normalized CO2-e reduction of HEFA-SPK of 95.5% compared to similar fossil fuels. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The development of clean and sustainable biofuel generation from sustainable feedstock using an integrated process intensification approach like hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) is essential now. The current research is a 'first of its kind' where hydrodynamic cavitation is integrated with heterogeneous catalyst, i.e. TiO2, to prepare thumba methyl esters (TME). So far, no studies on biodiesel production using heterogeneous catalysts using HC are reported in the literature. Experiments were performed with an optimized orifice plate to investigate the effects of operating parameters viz., Thumba oil to methanol molar ratio (1:4–1:8), TiO2 concentration (1–1.4% by weight of oil), and operating temperature (50 °C to 70 °C). Maximum triglyceride conversion (71.8%) was obtained at thumba oil to methanol ratio of 1:6, TiO2 concentration of 1.2% weight percentage and operating temperature of 60 °C in hydrodynamic cavitation reactor within 1 h at 5 bar. The cavitational yield for HC was found to be 9.3 × 10−6 moles L/J, which was almost 27% higher than the value for the conventional approach (3.37 × 10−7 moles L/J). The experimental data fitted second-order reaction kinetics w.r.t limiting reactant, i.e., thumba oil and first-order w.r.t excess reactant, i.e., methanol. The pre-exponential factor (k0) and activation energy (E) of the alcoholysis reaction was found to be 82.26 L2 mol−2 min−1 and 15.44 kJ/mol, respectively. The thermodynamic analysis suggested that the alcoholysis of the thumba oil followed the endergonic reaction pathway. Thumba methyl ester (TME) synthesized via this intensified approach is a novel and energy-efficient method compared to the conventional method. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The use of rice straw (RS) was enhanced to produce biobutanol as biofuel, for which the NaOH pretreatment was optimized by considering the butanol-biomass ratio that quantify the mass balance efficiency of the three sequential stages of the process: pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation by Clostridium beijerinckii. The optimum point (solid loading of 5% w/v with 0.75% w/v NaOH at 134 °C for 20 min) of the best cost-wise option yielded an enhanced biomass use of 77.6 g kg RS−1. A maximum butanol titer of 10.1 g L−1 was reached after 72 h of fermentation with the complete uptake of glucose and nearly complete uptake of xylose. The NaOH concentration was the most influential parameter. The appropriate dosage to maximize fermentable sugars instead of the mass balance efficiency of the three stages underestimated the biomass use by 13%, showing the importance of correctly selecting the variable response during optimization. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Although, metal-free electrocatalysts have been exhibiting attractive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance comparable to Pt/C in alkaline electrolytes, their activity in acidic and neutral mediums is unsatisfactory, hindering their widespread application in energy devices, such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), neutral metal-air batteries, and biofuel cells. Herein, N,P,S tri-doped holey carbon (NPS-HC) nanomaterials have been prepared using a one-step method with large specific surface area (1656.0 m2 g−1), abundant holes and edges, and high heteroatom content (7.57 at.%). The optimized NPS-HC exhibits outstanding ORR performance in universal pH mediums, being closely comparable to the commercial Pt/C. The NPS-HC is also utilized as air cathode in alkaline (peak power density: 286.6 mW cm−2 @ 488.1 mA cm−2) and neutral (85.7 mW cm−2 @ 228.8 mA cm−2) electrolytic Zn-air batteries as well as the ORR cathode in a practical PEMFC (275.1 mW cm−2) with comparable or superior performances than the previous reports. Such excellent electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the N,P,S tri-doping induced synergistic charge transfer and spin redistribution along with the hierarchical holey structure with exposed active sites and facilitated mass transport. Thus, this earth-abundant carbon-based nanomaterial holds great potential for high-performance pH-universal ORR catalysis in various energy-related technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The molecular, homogeneous catalyst 2,6-bis(4-isopropyl-2-oxazolinyl)pyridine palladium(II) was examined for the ability to perform selective hydrodeoxygenation of benzyl alcohol. Reaction conditions and substrate were chosen to mimic conditions used to depolymerize lignin biomass and subsequently convert the lignin-derived monomers into useful biofuels. The molecular catalyst exhibited moderate catalytic activity in methanol solvent with complete selectivity towards hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of benzyl alcohol under mild conditions, including room temperature. At elevated temperatures, the molecular catalyst decomposed into solid particles. These particles were characterized with XPS and contained metallic palladium, which also exhibited catalytic HDO activity. The particles also achieved complete selectivity towards hydrodeoxygenation over aromatic ring hydrogenation, but only at temperatures above 200 °C. Recycling the solid particle catalysts over multiple reaction cycles, led to the leaching of the catalytically active species back into solution and the eventual deactivation of the solid particles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The energy sector in Brazil produces liquid biofuels as bioethanol and biodiesel. The most common technique to produce biodiesel is the transesterification of oils extracted from biomass. Rice processing generates grain bran, an agricultural residue. Brazil is one of the main countries that produce this grain. Therefore, the objective of this study was to produce a renewable biofuel using vegetable oil from grain bran via homogeneous basic transesterification. There are only three experimental studies reported in the literature on the production of biodiesel from rice bran oil via alkaline transesterification. Furthermore, the studies do not include results regarding biodiesel acidity, iodine, saponification and moisture content. Although potassium hydroxide (KOH) is the most commonly deployed alkaline catalyst in industrial biodiesel production, there are no reports regarding ethyl biodiesel production using rice bran oil with this catalyst. Therefore, this study applied a factorial arrangement in the experimental phase to produce ethyl biodiesel from rice bran oil using KOH as a catalyst on transesterification. The factors including reaction time, alcohol/oil molar ratio and amount of catalyst allowed to determine the best conditions for biodiesel production. To determine the viability of the biodiesel production, it was necessary to analyze the main parameters required by the national standards, which were kinematic viscosity, iodine index, acidity index, saponification index and moisture. All the yielded biodiesel were complied with the standards of ANP, ASTM and EN, except kinematic viscosity, which ranged from 8.061 to 22.791 mm2s-1. According to the conditions of the factorial arrangement, the calculated kinematic viscosity indicated the need to raise the proportion of catalyst and/or the molar ratio between ethanol and KOH The lower kinematic viscosity, around 8–9 mm2s-1, occurred with 1.5% catalyst and, in general, with molar ratio 9:1. These results suggest that future studies could explore the production of high-quality ethyl biodiesel using rice bran vegetable oil. According to the results, it represents a viable possibility to produce fully renewable and sustainable biodiesel within the socio-economic, environmental and agricultural context in Brazil. © 2021

AB  - Thermochemical liquefaction can convert lignocellulosic biomass into a chemical platform for alternative biofuels or chemical synthons. The process is conducted with a solvent and an acidic catalyst at mild temperatures and atmospheric pressure. Most solvents used to conduct the process are petroleum-based. Studies involving more sustainable solvents are needed so that the global process can also be more sustainable and cleaner. The surplus of glycerol (e.g., biodiesel production), once derived from a vegetable source, can be converted into renewable and sustainable solvents, thus turning the liquefaction process cleaner. Pinewood shaves were liquefied with 2-ethylhexanol, set as a reference solvent, resulting in a biomass conversion of 71.2%. The liquefaction with the different solvents was carried out under the same conditions using pure solvents or combined with 2-ethylhexanol. The process with cyclic carbonates, from propylene and glycerol, led to the highest conversions, 96.5% and 98.7%, respectively. Additionally, the use of two glycerol acetals, solketal and formal glycerol, afforded bio-oils with high conversion rates, as well (>95%). On the other hand, the liquefaction of the biomass with propylene glycol converted to 79.4%. The bio-oils obtained from pinewood shaves’ liquefaction with glycerol carbonate and propylene carbonate led to significantly better calorific properties than those from the biomass itself. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Laccases and laccase-mediator systems (LMS) are versatile catalysts that can oxidize a broad range of substrates coupled to the sole reduction of dioxygen to water. They possess many biotechnological applications in paper, textile, and food industries, bioethanol production, organic synthesis, detection and degradation of pollutants, and biofuel cell development. In particular, bacterial laccases are getting relevance due to their activity in a wide range of pH and temperature and their robustness under harsh conditions. However, the enzyme and the redox mediator's availability and costs limit their large-scale commercial use. Here we demonstrate that β-(10-phenothiazyl)-propionic acid can be used as an efficient and low-cost redox mediator for decolorizing synthetic dyes by the recombinant laccase SilA from Streptomyces ipomoeae produced in E. coli. This new LMS can decolorize more than 80% indigo carmine and malachite green in 1 h at pH = 8.0 and 2 h in tap water (pH = 6.8). Furthermore, it decolorized more than 40% of anthraquinone dye remazol brilliant blue R and 80% of azo dye xylidine ponceau in 5 h at 50 °C, pH 8.0. It supported at least 3 decolorization cycles without losing activity, representing an attractive candidate for a cost-effective and environmentally friendly LMS functional at neutral to alkaline pH. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells are a promising and environmentally friendly technology for energy generation from renewable fuel sources. Glucose biofuel cells employ enzymatic catalysts at both the anode and cathode to oxidize glucose and reduce oxygen while producing electricity. Consequently, there is a need for materials capable of immobilizing enzymes and facilitating efficient electron transfer between an electrode surface and an enzymatic active site. Here, we describe a chloroferrocene-modified linear poly(ethylenimine) capable of mediating electro-enzymatic oxygen reduction by laccase. Enzymatic biocathodes constructed using this mediator generated current densities up to 2.66 mA cm−2, and up to 636 μW cm−2 (Eoc = 0.6 V) power when combined with a tetramethylferrocene-mediated glucose oxidase bioanode to construct a biofuel cell mediated entirely by ferrocenes. © 2021

AB  - A new catalyst was synthesized from the South American Silver Croaker's stone − the Silver Croaker is a fish widely consumed in Brazil and the stone is a residue from the fish's head. The stone and the bio-based catalyst obtained from it were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, thermogravimetric analysis, surface area, and soluble alkalinity. It was confirmed that the stone is composed of aragonite (calcium carbonate) and the catalyst obtained by calcination of calcium oxide (CaO). The catalytic activity was evaluated by transesterification reactions. The process was optimized by surface response methodology based on Box – Behnken design. Methanol:oil molar ratio of 11.8, 5.33 wt% of catalyst, 175 min of reaction time, and 67.85 °C were identified as optimal conditions, reaching conversions close to 99% and ester content of 97.4%. The catalyst derived from silver croaker stone was reused 5 times while maintaining its high performance. Thus, a new application was given to this little-known waste, showing its potential as a catalyst in the synthesis of biodiesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production is becoming more and more important lately and different methods for production are searched. Thus, biodiesel can be obtained from different vegetable oils or animal fats using catalysts. The aim of this research was to prepare the Fe3O4/MnO2 nanocomposite and test them as catalyst to efficiently obtain biofuel like the final product from the oil obtained from seeds and grapes residues by microwave-assisted transesterification. Synthesized Fe3O4/MnO2 nanocomposites using chemically and biochemically (using plant extracts) route were characterized regarding size, crystallinity, composition, porosity and specific surface area. The analysis of the final results revealed that the samples chemically prepared show smaller sizes, specific surface area higher and porosity lower than the sample prepared using plant extract. The Fe3O4/MnO2 nanocomposites with the highest specific surface area from all prepared nanocomposites were tested for microwave-assisted transesterification studies. These nanocomposites, used as catalyst, determine an increasing reaction rate of the transesterification process thus being a promising route for biodiesel production. © 2021, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The intense growth rate of granular bacteria biomass (GB) in anaerobic wastewater treatment units has made environmental problems with its disposal. In this research the potential of pyrolysis method to convert granular bacteria biomass to biofuels was completely investigated. The non-catalytic experiments were performed in a temperature range of 400 to 700 °C and the maximum liquid product yield on dry ash-free basis (55.0 %wt.) was obtained at optimum temperature of 550 °C. Pyrolysis of pretreated granular bacteria with 5 wt% HCl (PGB) and then impregnation with Na2CO3 (IPGB) was studied to improve the bio-oil quality as well as higher amount of synthesis gas. Feedstock pretreatment with acid decreased the gas yield in 550 °C while Na2CO3 pretreatment had reverse effect, with H2 yield (mmol/g feed) of 2.9, 2.4 and 1.8 for IPGB, GB and PGB respectively. It means Na2CO3 exhibited excellent catalytic activity toward producing hydrogen-rich hydrocarbons. Acid treatment increased bio-oil weight percent with little effect on the quality, while the IPGB pyrolysis resulted 8.3% and 8.6% decrease in the oxygenates and nitrogenates respectively and 19.5% increase in the hydrocarbons which improved the higher heating value (HHV) from 32.6 MJ/kg to 33.7 MJ/kg in comparison with GB. The raw and treated biomass was characterized by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-DTG), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), elemental analyses (CHNS), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). The bio-products were analyzed by a gas chromatography-thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD), a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and CHNS. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nannochloropsis gaditana is a microalga, constituting cellulose 33 ± 1.3% and hemicellulose 18.2 ± 0.8%; used for the biofuel production. The cellulose in microalgal biomass would contribute to protecting the environment and constitute an attractive renewable raw material for bioethanol production. Ethanol production from N. gaditana microalgal biomass was investigated through Consolidated Bioprocessing (CBP) using Hangateiclostridium thermocellum KSMK1203 bacterial isolate. Screening and optimization of biomass pretreatment with different acids in different dosages, various hydrolysis time at 100 °C were performed and statistically validated using one-way ANOVA for efficient hemicellulose removal from NaClO2-treated N. gaditana biomass. Medium components and process parameters were statistically optimized by Response Surface Methodology. The maximum cellulase of 13.96 ± 1.354 IU/mL and ethanol of 12.90 ± 0.987 g/L were obtained in pretreated N.gaditana biomass. This study demonstrates that N. gaditana is a substitution for vegetal cellulose and these optimized conditions could be successfully used for commercial ethanol production using H. thermocellum KSMK1203. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolytic bio-oils derived from renewable organic wastes are credible second-generation biofuels. In crude form, bio-oils are inherently complex mixtures that largely limit their direct application as fuels and integration into existing petroleum infrastructure, without additional upgrading. Herein, we report on low-oxygenated biofuel production from milk processing sludge using a multistage process configuration. In the first stage, bio-oil yields were maximised (57.7%) under slow pyrolysis conditions at 450 °C. Bio-oils were enriched in aliphatic hydrocarbons (19–22% alkanes), (11–14% alkenes) and alkyl nitriles (57–63%), while aromatics remained low at &lt;2%. A relatively low bio-oil O/C molar ratio (0.08 to 0.1) and a correspondingly high HHV (40.8–41.8 MJ/kg) display possible fuel applications. Increasing pyrolysis temperatures (&gt;450 °C) was not beneficial to bio-oil yields, reduced hydrocarbon contents and increased heteroatoms (O, S, N). In the second stage, sulphided Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalysed hydroprocessing and distillation upgrading of bio-oils generated 100% C8-C22 saturated alkane distillates. With regard to fuel properties, oxygenation (0.26–0.89%), viscosities (4–6 mm2/s) and densities (ca.0.82 g/cm3) were comparable to standard diesel fuels. Resultant HHV (46.24 MJ/kg) and cetane index (69) of distillates produced from 450 °C bio-oils far exceeded those of diesel fuel standards, demonstrating direct fuel application and petroleum fuel compatibility. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by incipient wet impregnation and tested in hydrodeoxygenation reactions for conversion of oleic acid to n-C17 alkanes at optimal conditions. The high conversion of 96.5% to renewable biodiesel (RD) is justified with the characterization results, showing that the catalyst has good texture properties, presence of metallic Pt evidenced by 2θ reflections and binding energies, as well as adequate dispersion of active phase and nanoparticle size. 20% and 40% mixtures of RD with diesel were used. At full load a slight decrease in potency was observed when using RD mixtures and comparing them with petrodiesel; fortunately, the RD mixtures showed significant reductions in air pollutants, RD40 achieved reductions greater than 22% for CO, HC, and near 43% in emissions of smoke when compared to diesel. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Abstract: Biomethanation of the syngas from biomass gasification provides an alternative method for production of biofuel and chemicals. CO in syngas plays a key role in biomethanation of syngas, as it is both a substrate and an inhibitor of certain methanogenesis processes. In this study, CO biomethanation by using a mixture of N2 and CO as the gas substrate, was investigated with the help of 5 adapted anaerobic granular sludges under thermophilic and mesophilic conditions. The results show that CO biomethanation by the adapted inocula is omnipresent. The sludge from the juice plant has a methane yield more than 80% of the theoretical value both at 37 °C and 55 °C. Increasing the temperature from 37 °C to 55 °C has a slight effect on the final methane production, but can significantly increase the CO consumption rate and shorten the time for CO biomethanation.

AB  - The performance of biofuel cells (BFCs) depends on the number of electrons that can be harvested from one fuel molecule by the bioanode, as well as many other factors. Regular, one-enzyme bioanodes can usually harvest two electrons per fuel molecule, lowering the conversion efficiency of chemical energy stored in the fuel to electrical energy. In this study, we successfully develop a high-performance BFC with a two-enzyme bioanode that can harvest four electrons by oxidizing lactate to acetylphosphate through a two-step enzymatic reaction that uses lactate oxidase (LOx) and pyruvate oxidase (POx). A current of 1 mA is obtained from the BFC for 2500 s, with only a slight decrease in the cell voltage, reaching 0 V at 3010 s. During this time, a total of 1253 mJ is harvested. This is approximately 1.8-fold the time and double the energy that is obtained from a corresponding one-enzyme-bioanode BFC employing only LOx, thus confirming that twice the number of electrons are harvested per lactate molecule. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - HZSM-5 is modified by Dawson-type phospho-wolframic (PW) acid, and the effects of PW loading on the weight-loss characteristics and reaction kinetics parameters of biomass pyrolysis are analyzed. Besides, the yield and moisture content of liquid and the organic phase composition is detected. The results show that the addition of HZSM-5 make the thermo-gravimetric curves shifted to the low-temperature side. However, with the increase of PW loading, the curves gradually are shifted back to the high-temperature side, and the maximum weight-loss rate decrease. The reaction order increases from 1.97 to 2.12, the activation energy decreases from 53.32 kJ/mol to 31.15 kJ/mol, and the frequency factor decreased from 8.27×104 s-1 to 9.61×102 s-1, indicating that the complexity of the conversion process increases and the severity decreases. The 10%PW/HZSM-5 catalysis decreases organic phase yield to 10.73 %, but increases high heating value to 38.01 MJ/kg, and promotes the content of I-type mono-aromatic hydrocarbons to 52.29 %. Besides, the content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is only 12.32%, and it shows a higher selectivity for BTEX. When the PW loading is increased to 20%, the hydrocarbon composition deteriorates slightly, and the conversion degree of oxygen-containing organics decreases. © 2021, Solar Energy Periodical Office Co., Ltd.

AB  - Non-edible jatropha oil was catalyzed by the sulfurated NiMo/activated clay catalyst to produce the second generation biodiesel. By the method of isovolumetric impregnation plus in-situ activation by CS2, a sulfurated NiMo/activated clay catalyst was prepared, and the structure and performance of the catalyst were studied by XRD, BET, Py-FTIR and NH3-TPD techniques. The effects of different reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, catalyst dosage, hydrogen pressure, reaction time on the reaction were investigated. The experimental results show that the optimal reaction conditions are as follows: the reaction temperature is 300 ℃, the catalyst mass fraction is 7.5%, the initial hydrogen pressure of the reaction is 3.5 MPa, and the reaction time is 60 min. Under these conditions, the conversion ratio of jatropha oil and the selectivity to C15-C18 reached 84.53% and 95.19%, respectively. The main components of optimal product were analyzed. With the sulfurated NiMo/activated clay, the second generation biodiesel with the main components of C15-C18 alkenes was obtained via the reactions of hydrogenation saturation, hydrodeoxygenation, hydrodecarbonylation and cracking. © 2021, Editorial Department of Journal of Hunan University.

AB  - The kinetic parameters for the pyrolysis of biomass of the pitch pine (Rigida pine P. Mill) were examined by thermogravimetric analysis in the temperature range 25 °C to 700 °C, in which the main decomposition was occurred from 250 °C to 400 °C. Pyrolysis of pitch pine has been investigated in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor. In this system, silica sand and nitrogen were used as the fluidizing bed material and fluidizing medium, respectively. The experimental was systemically performed on different temperature, fluidized velocity, and particle size of biomass. The optimum temperature condition at which the bio-oil yields reached the highest value (65.5%) was 500 °C. In addition, the higher heating values of bio-oils from pitch pine biomass were reached in the range 22 MJ/kg to 24 MJ/kg. Moreover, this bio-oil had high content of useful chemicals including such as levoglucosan, furfural, and guaiacol. The large amount of C5–C11 (gasoline fraction) produced make the pyrolyzed oil originating from pitch pine trees a promising biofuel candidate. © 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - A preliminary evaluation of the techno-economic feasibility of an industrial glycerol etherification process for bio-additives production has been carried out. The attention has been focused on the etherification reaction in presence of isobutylene (IB) or tert-butanol (TBA) in a batch reactor, catalyzed by an optimized heterogeneous system. Specifically, the Hyflon-based catalyst resulted more efficient and selective to desired products than commercial resin, limiting the competitive reactions of IB oligomerization and byproduct formation. In case of IB, a mixture of poly-ethers, suitable as oxygenated additives for diesel engines, containing very low amount of mono-tert-butylethers (<2 wt.%) was obtained in a single step. This allowed a simplification of the process without the need of separation units and a lower production cost with respect to other reference processes. When TBA was used and water was formed as byproduct, a permeoselective membrane was exploited improving the glycerol conversion and enhancing the poly-ethers productivity by continuous water removal. In fact, very high poly-ethers yield (>85%) was achieved under optimized reaction conditions. The analysis of the whole process demonstrated the techno-economic sustainability of the proposed routes, leading to a production price of glycerol poly-ethers of 1,14 USD/kg and 2,38 USD/kg, by using IB or TBA respectively. © 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - The broad applications of implantable glucose biofuel cells (GBFCs) have become very attractive in biomedical sciences. The key challenge of GBFCs is eliminating the inevitable product H2O2 generated from the oxidation of glucose when glucose oxidase (GOx) is used as a catalyst while improving the performance of GBFCs. In this work, the cascade electrocatalyst, RBCs@NPDA was obtained through the in situ polymerization of dopamine to form nanopolydopamine (NPDA) on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). The RBCs@NPDA can catalyze both fuels of H2O2 and O2, so as to generate a high cathodic current (0.414 mA cm-2). Furthermore, when RBCs@NPDA was used as a cathodic catalyst in the membraneless GBFC, it exhibited the cascade catalytic activity in the reduction of O2-H2O2 and minimized the damage to RBCs caused by the high concentration of H2O2. The mechanism research indicates that RBCs@NPDA integrates the property of NPDA and RBCs. Specifically, NPDA plays a catalase-like role in catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2, while RBCs play a laccase-like role in electrocatalyzing the O2 reduction reaction. This work offers the cascade catalyst for improving the performance of implantable GBFC and presents a strategy for constructing catalysts using living cells and nanomaterials to replace deformable and unstable enzymes in other biofuel cells. ©

AB  - Enzymes are promising electrocatalysts in many biological processes. We proposed two strategies, co-immobilization and three-dimensional (3D) space design, to strengthen electron transfer (ET). In this research, DNA base and CNT were mixed in an aqueous solution; then the mixture was dried and ground. Finally, the powder was annealed in N2 to obtain DNA derived N-doped 3D conductive network (N-G@CNT). N-G@CNT immobilized mediators on itself through adsorption. Such 3D space structure shows high activity toward a set of critical electrochemical reactions and high-performance in enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs). It is found that N-G@CNT conductive network possesses an interconnected porous structure and well-developed porosity. As a result, the membrane-less EBFCs equipped with enzyme/mediator co-immobilization N-G@CNT bioelectrodes were measured in a model 5 mM glucose-containing aqueous solution, human serum, and rabbit whole blood, respectively, which can generate 0.34, 0.078, and 0.15 mW cm−2 power density, respectively. The constant-current discharge method carried out in a model 5 mM glucose-containing aqueous solution shows that the discharge time reached 19 h at a discharge current density of 0.01 mA cm−2. The membrane EBFCs can deliver a high open circuit voltage of 0.68 V, a short-circuit current density of 2 mA cm−2, and a maximum power density of 0.5 mW cm−2. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A series of multicyclic hydrocarbons were synthesized in high yield and under mild conditions from 2,5-hexanedione, cyclohexanone and cyclopentanone, on a scale of 200 g. Aldol products were obtained with conversions of 95% (2,5-hexanedione), 80-90% (cyclopentanone) and 75-80% (cyclohexanone), based on the consumption of starting materials. Cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone aldol condensations resulted in mixtures containing mainly bicyclic products (90%) as well as tricyclic analogs (&lt;10%). The 2,5-hexanedione aldol condensation produced 50% methylcyclopentenone (MCP) as expected and about 50% oligomers. Surprisingly, the complex heavy fraction after the removal of MCP contained mainly the products of Michael addition of MCP and only a minor fraction of the self-aldol condensation product of MCP. The hydrogenation-hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of cyclohexanone- and cyclopentanone-derived reactants with a nickel on alumina (Ni-Al2O3) catalyst at 250 °C and pressures between 800 and 1200 psig produced the expected saturated hydrocarbons with good recovery (80% and 76% respectively), with only small amounts of oxygenated residual starting materials remaining (&lt;2%). However, the HDO of the 2,5-hexanedione aldol mixture produced an equally complex mixture compared to its respective aldol/Michael addition product which contained unreacted oxygenates. All crude mixtures, only treated to remove water after HDO unless stated otherwise, were evaluated for their properties as potential compression-ignition fuels: distillation curve, derived cetane number, sooting tendency, lower heating value, density, flash point and cold flow properties. The results show the utility of these hydrocarbons as viable compression-ignition fuels or blendstocks, particularly the cyclopentanone- or cyclohexanone-derived products. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Clostridium tyrobutyricum (C. tyrobutyricum) is a fermentation strain used to produce butyric acid. A promising new biofuel, n-butanol, can be produced by catalysis of butyrate, which can be obtained through microbial fermentation. Butyric acid has various uses in food additives and flavor agents, antiseptic substances, drug formulations, and fragrances. Its use as a food flavoring has been approved by the European Union, and it has therefore been listed on the EU Lists of Flavorings. As butyric acid fermentation is a cost-efficient process, butyric acid is an attractive feedstock for various biofuels and food commercialization products. 12C6+ irradiation has advantages over conventional mutation methods for fermentation production due to its dosage conformity and excellent biological availability. Nevertheless, the effects of these heavy-ion irradiations on the specific productiveness of C. tyrobutyricum are still uncertain. We developed non-structured mathematical models to represent the heavy-ion irradiation of C. tyrobutyricum in biofermentation reactors. The kinetic models reflect various fermentation features of the mutants, including the mutant strain growth model, butyric acid formation model, and medium consumption model. The models were constructed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo model and logistic regression. Models were verified using experimental data in response to different initial glucose concentrations (0–180 g/L). The parameters of fixed proposals are applied in the various fermentation stages. Predictions of these models were in accordance well with the results of fermentation assays. The maximum butyric acid production was 56.3 g/L. Our study provides reliable information for increasing butyric acid production and for evaluating the feasibility of using mutant strains of C. tyrobutyricum at the pre-development phase. © Copyright © 2021 Cao, Gao, Wang, Shu, Hu, Xie, Cui, Guo and Zhou.

AB  - Continuous microwave pyrolysis, an advanced method that can realize continuous large-scale feeding under high temperature, has the potential to improve the yield and quality of biofuels, which can address the limits of batch microwave pyrolysis of low efficiencies of resources and energy. However, the energy conversion and pyrolysis mechanisms of continuous microwave pyrolysis remain poorly understood, which may be a key to its highly efficient industrial application. This work addresses this issue by comparing the distribution, compositions, and quality of biofuels obtained by two pyrolysis technologies and then the energy efficiency is analyzed in detail. Thus, the energy conversion mechanism and pyrolysis mechanism of continuous microwave pyrolysis was explored via in-depth study of batch microwave pyrolysis in previous studies. The results demonstrate that continuous microwave pyrolysis offers advantages in terms of the increased yields and quality of biofuels. The maximum biofuels yield of continuous microwave pyrolysis was 72.16% and the maximum lower heating value of bio-gas and bio-oil was 19.50 MJ/Nm3 and 25.58 MJ/Kg, respectively. Moreover, continuous microwave pyrolysis significantly improved energy efficiency of the process under extended continuous operation, which reached a maximum of 18.47%. The improved performance of continuous microwave pyrolysis is due to continuous high-temperature instantaneous feeding coupling with the conveying and stirring functions of auger increase of the mass transfer and heat transfer between the feedstock and pyrolysis products. This work provides an appropriate process option and theoretical basis of continuous microwave pyrolysis for developing the industrial production of high-grade biofuels from wastes. © 2021

AB  - The manufacturing of coffee, one of the most popular beverages globally, renders enormous amounts of by-products and wastes, which may trigger severe environmental issues if not treated appropriately. The coffee pulp, resulting from the wet processing of coffee, is the predominant by-product, with around 10 Mt annually produced worldwide. For the first time, this work addresses the hydrothermal treatment of coffee pulp to produce biofuels and platform molecules, scrutinising the influence of the processing conditions (temperature, pressure, reaction time and solid/water ratio) on the process. This strategy allowed the transformation of coffee pulp into bio-crude and hydrochar in different yields (10–26% and 10–42%, respectively), depending on the conditions. The bio-crude included a pool of alkanes, carboxylic acids, ketones, phenols and nitrogen species, with varying quantities of C (54–71 wt%), H (6–7 wt%), O (18–34 wt%) and N (3–5 wt%) and a calorific value shifting from 23 to 32 MJ/kg. The hydrochar contained different proportions of C (57–72 wt%), H (4–6 wt%), O (20–35 wt%) and N (2–3 wt%) and had a calorific value between 22 and 29 MJ/kg. Process optimisation showed that up to 45% of the coffee pulp could be simultaneously converted into energy-rich (29 MJ/kg), merchantable liquid (20% bio-crude) and solid (24% hydrochar) biofuels during the treatment of a 15 wt% coffee pulp suspension at 320 °C and 162 bar for 1 h. At the same time, a bio-crude with a high proportion of profitable phenolic derivatives (42%) can be attained in high yield (25%) when a 5 wt% suspension is treated at 280 °C and 120 bar for 2 h. These promising results, along with the bespoke nature of this hydrothermal treatment, are a landmark achievement for the economy and sustainability of coffee producer countries, thus representing a pioneering step change towards the sustainable management of early-stage coffee leftovers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The re-utilization or recycling of waste completely was a big task to build the zero-waste city, and refuse derived fuel (RDF) preparation might be a potential way to recycle those variations organic wastes from industry and municipal sector, while the chemical binder was usually employed to match the mechanical property of RDF. In this work, a green-RDF was developed using wastes with different sources directly. Resin-like industrial solid waste, i.e., automotive stamping gaskets and electronic packing wastes (AE = 56%), anaerobic digestion sludge (ADS = 24%) and industrial desiccant residue (IDR = 20%), were selected and optimized to prepare green-RDF based on the previous market survey and characteristics analysis. The extending rate (ER), impact resistance index (IRI), and lower heating value (LHV) was 17.51%, 116.67% and 6.84 MJ/kg. The combustion performance of RDF was operated through TG/DSC-MS and combustion simulator with on-line FTIR gas analyzer simultaneously. The releasing temperature range for SO2 and NOx was narrowed to 211–401 °C and 212–803 °C, with the SO2 and NOx reduction of 63% and 26%, respectively, since IDR additives contributed to fixation of them in the residues through the chemical adsorption and oxidation reduction reaction. Green-RDF might be a promising method for the energy recovery from solid waste with different sources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent abnormal climate changes resulted in the dramatic alternation of rainfall and flood patterns in many countries. The massive generation of flood debris, a mixture of soil (sediment), biomass, plastic, metal, and various hazardous materials, poses various environmental and public health problems. This study suggests a sustainable technical platform to convert the hazardous materials into value-added products. CO2-assisted pyrolysis was used to thermally convert flood debris into syngas (H2 and CO). CO2 enhanced the syngas production due to gas phase homogeneous reactions (HRs) between CO2 and volatile hydrocarbons evolved from pyrolysis of flood debris. For improvement of HRs in line with enhancement of syngas production, additional thermal energy and earth abundant catalyst were used. In particular, Ni/SiO2 catalyst increased more than one order of magnitude higher syngas production, comparing to non-catalytic pyrolysis. Synergistic effect of CO2 and Ni catalyst showed nearly 50% more production of syngas in reference to catalytic pyrolysis under N2. During flood debris pyrolysis, compositional matrix of flood debris was also determined by detecting index chemicals of waste materials that cannot be identified by naked eyes. Thus, this study confirmed that CO2-assisted pyrolysis is a useful tool for conversion of flood debris into value-added chemicals. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Furfural acetals with high octane value, high calorific value and high oxidation resistance are considered promising biofuels or fuel precursors with huge potential demand. However, there are few studies on efficient scalable catalyst systems, including continuous-flow catalyst systems, for their preparation. In this work, TiO2 nanoparticles supported on exfoliated montmorillonite, with strong Lewis acid sites and abundant accessible Brønsted acid sites, is used to catalyze the acetalization reactions of biomass-derived furfural and alcohols. Low dosage of the catalyst made the reaction reach equilibrium in a very short time (TOF=690–1305 min−1) at room temperature with the acetal as the only product. In continuous-flow reactions, the catalyst showed a stable product output with conversion close to that for the batch reaction with a short catalyst-reactant contact time of 150 s. Contrast experiments revealed that both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst were indispensable for maximizing the catalytic performance, and simultaneously activating both furfural and alcohol on the adjacent Lewis and Brønsted acid sites was proposed to be responsible for the high catalytic performance. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Alternative and green sources of energy are needed to replace rapidly depleting and non-renewable fossil fuels. Abundant and renewable lignocellulose biomass can be transformed into value-added chemicals and biofuels that are currently derived from non-renewable fossil fuels. The conversion of lignocellulose biomass has been extensively investigated over heterogeneous catalysts via various catalytic processes. In particular, solid acid catalysts possessing both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites have drawn significant research interest. Among these catalysts, metal phosphates are of particular interest due to their relatively facile synthesis routes, low cost, environmental friendliness, and tunable Lewis and Brønsted acid sites. In this tutorial review, we have provided a brief overview of the synthesis methodologies and have summarized several catalytic processes involved in biomass upgrading, including dehydration, oxidation, transfer hydrogenation, transesterification, hydrogenolysis, and hydrodeoxygenation over metal phosphate catalysts to produce value-added chemicals and biofuels. The main emphasis is to highlight the relationship between the textural properties of the catalysts and their catalytic performances and to elucidate future research opportunities available in this exciting area. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Bio-oil is a condensable liquid obtained from pyrolysis of biomass, which is the feedstock not only for the production of biofuels, but also for the production of functional carbon materials. In this study, carbon materials derived from the polymerization of bio-oil and furfural were treated with varied methods and were used as catalysts for the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline with hydrazine hydrate as a reductant. The results showed that the oxidation of carbon materials with HNO3formed more CO and CN functionalities, and created some defects, while the doping with urea led to the elimination of the carbonyl functionalities. The presence of N species in the carbon materials changed the electronic state of the carbon atom and induced the skeleton expansion of the graphite structure in the carbon materials, creating remarkably more defect sites than from the oxidation with HNO3. These defective structures were essential for endowing the carbon materials with superior catalytic activity and stability for the selective reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Empty fruit bunch (EFB), which is one of the primary agricultural wastes generated from the palm oil plantation, is generally discharged into the open environment or ends up in landfills. The utilization of this EFB waste for other value-added applications such as activated carbon and biofuels remain low, despite extensive research efforts. One of the reasons is that the EFB is highly vulnerable to microbial and fungi degradation under natural environment owning to its inherent characteristic of high organic matter and moisture content. This can rapidly deteriorate its quality and results in poor performance when processed into other products. However, the lignocellulosic components in degraded EFB (DEFB) still largely remain intact. Consequently, it could become a promising feedstock for production of bio-products after suitable pretreatment with organic solvents. In this study, DEFB was subjected to five different types of organic solvents for the pretreatment, including ethanol, ethylene glycol, 2-propanol, acetic acid and acetone. The effects of temperature and residence time were also investigated during the pretreatment. Organosolv pretreatment in ethylene glycol (50 v/v%) with the addition of NaOH (3 v/v%) as an alkaline catalyst successfully detached 81.5 wt.% hemicellulose and 75.1 wt.% lignin. As high as 90.4 wt.% cellulose was also successfully retrieved at mild temperature (80◦C) and short duration (45 min), while the purity of cellulose in treated DEFB was recorded at 84.3%. High-purity lignin was successfully recovered from the pretreatment liquor by using sulfuric acid for precipitation. The amount of recovered lignin from alkaline ethylene glycol liquor was 74.6% at pH 2.0. The high recovery of cellulose and lignin in DEFB by using organosolv pretreatment rendered it as one of the suitable feedstocks to be applied in downstream biorefinery processes.

AB  - In order to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy technologies such as wind power and solar photovoltaic power systems have recently become more widespread. However, Japan as a nation faces high reliance on imported fossil fuels for electricity generation despite having great potential for further renewable energy development. The focus of this study examines untapped geographical locations in Japan’s northern most prefecture, Hokkaido, that possess large wind power potential. The possibility of exploiting this potential for the purpose of producing green hydrogen is explored. In particular, its integration with a year-round conversion of Kraft lignin into bio-oil from nearby paper pulp mills through a near critical water depolymerization process is examined. The proposed bio-oil and aromatic chemical production, as well as the process’ economics are calculated based upon the total available Kraft lignin in Hokkaido, including the magnitude of wind power capacity that would be required for producing the necessary hydrogen for such a large-scale process. Green hydrogen integration with other processes in Japan and in other regions is also discussed. Finally, the potential benefits and challenges are outlined from an energy policy point-of-view. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Biomass has drawn much attention, due to renewable and green energy against environmental degradation and energy shortage in recent decades. Pyrolysis of biomass in anaerobic/anoxic conditions can be an important way to produce high value-added biofuels, such as alkanes, hydrocarbons, aromatics, and phenol derivatives. However, the bio-oil from biomass direct pyrolysis is a type of complex oxygen-containing mixture, composed of organic acids, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, phenols, and sugars. The bio-oil is difficult to be directly used, because of high acidity, low calorific value, and thermal stability. In this study, a combination of hydrochloric acid washing and torrefaction pretreatment was proposed to improve the quality of bio-oil from biomass pyrolysis, in order to deal with the high oxygen content, strong corrosiveness, and a wide variety of compounds in bio-oil. The physical and chemical properties of sweet sorghum straw were measured before and after pretreatment. The results showed that the simple pickling was beneficial to the generation of volatiles, whereas, the torrefaction pretreatment alone reduced the ratio of H/C and O/C, while increased the energy yield up to 95.13%, particularly on the increased generation of carbon. The combination of pickling and torrefaction pretreatment also significantly increased the biochar and non-condensable gases. A pyrolysis test was carried out in a horizontal tube furnace (OTF-1200X). The high purity N2 was used as the protective gas, and the flow rate was 100 mL/min. The program was set to raise the temperature to 500℃, and the quartz boat containing 10 g samples was quickly pushed into the central constant temperature section of the tubular furnace. At this time, the temperature changed within ±2℃ and returned to 500 ℃ within 1 min. The heating stopped after 30 min. The test results showed that the acid washing, torrefaction, and combined pretreatment reduced 62, 58, and 68 compounds in the bio-oil from sweet sorghum straw pyrolysis, compared with 111, respectively, while the contents of ketones, acids, and furans were all reduced. There was a weak catalytic effect of most metal ions that were removed by pickling on the acetyl group in the pyrolysis process. A significant decrease was observed in the acetic acid content and the acidic components in the bio-oil for a better corrosion resistance of bio-oil. Furthermore, the pickling and torrefaction pretreatment improved the carbohydrate compounds, and the precious D-Allose, a kind of very rare monosaccharide in nature, particularly with the very limited synthesis amount but a high medicinal value. Allosose was expected to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, while protecting islet β cells of diabetic animals. In addition, the combined pickling and pretreatment also promoted the formation of nonanoic acid and valeric acid, with a high yield of furfural, where the yield was higher at about 500℃. Furfural was a kind of chemical product with high added value, widelyused in resin, varnish, and organic reagent in the food industry. Simple torrefaction was beneficial to increase the relative content of cellulose in biomass, rich in -OH functional group, thereby for the high content of phenols in bio-oil. Although no new substances were formed, the pH value was significantly improved in the bio-oil. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Green house effect and ozone layer depletion due continuous environmental pollution from fossil fuel has speed up the quest for search of alternative energy fuel. In recent year, biofouls has attracted much attention as a reliable substitute to fossil fuel. The objective of this study was to evaluate and characterize biofuel produced from Egusi vegetable oil by applying standard method of transesterification. This study was carried out at Processing and Storage Engineering Departmental (PSED) laboratory of National Centre for Agricultural Mechanization (NCAM), Ilorin Kwara State, Nigeria. The results of the proximate characterization of the produced Egusi vegetable oil shows crude protein, crude fibre, ether extract, moisture content, ash content and carbohydrate composition of 20.6%, 13.3%, 50.6%, 4.3%, 3.0% and 8.2% respectively. The transesterification of Egusi vegetable oil in this study yielded 63.7% of methyl ester. The characterization results of the biofuel produced shows kinematic viscosity, density, cloud point, flash point, pour point, fire point, acid value, iodine value, saponification and specific gravity values of 4.6, 0.714, 5, 210,-3, 250, 0.54, 0.69, 0.26 and 0.915 respectively. The results were compared with the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM 6751) for standard. Information from this study will expand the scope of knowledge on the search for an alternative fuel to fossil fuel. Also, this will serve as a guide in both policy and management of global warming. © 2021, Int. Comm. of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuels as alternatives to fossil-based conventional fuels have been considered as a get-away strategy that could partially address some of the environmental concerns. The combustion of biomass-derived liquid fuels such as biodiesel has gained significant importance in practical combustion systems such as diesel engines. The aims of this study were to investigate combustion, performance, and exhaust emissions by using Moringa oleífera biodiesel-diesel blend (BIO) as fuel substitutes for a four-stroke single cylinder engine with direct injection. The physicochemical properties of Moringa oleífera methyl esters and its blend fully matched with the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. The experimental results revealed an earlier start of combustion and shorter ignition delay for BIO as compared to diesel, whereas the general profile of the rate of heat release diagram is quite similar for both fuels. Engine performance test results showed an increase of the brake specific fuel consumption and the exhaust gas temperature when BIO was used; however, brake thermal efficiency decreased. The carbon monoxide (CO) emission for BIO was found 13.08% lower than diesel fuel, but NOx concentrations slightly increased by 7.20%. The Moringa oleífera biodiesel-diesel blend (BIO) can replace diesel fuel without modifying engines to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. © 2021 Asociacion de Quimicos del Instituto Quimico de Sarria.

AB  - In the present work, effect of hydrothermal temperature from 120 to 160 °C on TiO2 physicochemical properties as well as its photocatalytic activity towards biodiesel production using waste cooking oil (WCO) was investigated. TiO2 was synthesized via hydrothermal method using Titanium butoxide, Ti(OBu)4 as the precursor and nitric acid, HNO3 as the peptizing agent. Next, the synthesized photocatalyst was dried at 60 °C for 24 h and later calcined at 400 °C for 2 h. The synthesized TiO2 was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Burnauer- Emmet- Teller (BET) to determine their crystallinity and textural properties. Results showed that all synthesized TiO2 have a mixture of anatase and rutile phase and N2 adsorption- desorption isotherm for all catalyst possess Type IV isotherm according to IUPAC classification with hysteresis loop of type H1. Then, all the synthesized catalysts were tested for biodiesel production using esterified waste cooking oil under visible light irradiation for 1 h and 10 min. Percentage of fatty acid methyl ester (FAMEs) present in the synthesized biodiesel was determined using gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). The synthesized catalyst (T24_160) showed a good photocatalytic activity as the percentage of biodiesel yield was higher (3.41%) compared to the other catalyst. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - The ambitious CO2 emission reduction targets for the transport sector set in the Paris Climate Agreement require low-carbon energy solutions that can be commissioned rapidly. The production of gasoline, kerosene, and diesel from renewable methanol using methanol-to-olefins (MTO) and Mobil’s Olefins to Gasoline and Distillate (MOGD) syntheses was investigated in this study via process simulation and economic analysis. The current work presents a process simulation model comprising liquid fuel production and heat integration. According to the economic anal-ysis, the total cost of production was found to be 3409 €/tfuels (273 €/MWhLHV), corresponding to a renewable methanol price of 963 €/t (174 €/MWhLHV). The calculated fuel price is considerably higher than the current cost of fossil fuels and biofuel blending components. The price of renewable methanol, which is largely dictated by the cost of electrolytic hydrogen and renewable electricity, was found to be the most significant factor affecting the profitability of the MTO-MOGD plant. To reduce the price of renewable fuels and make them economically viable, it is recommended that the EU’s sustainable transport policies are enacted to allow flexible and practical solutions to reduce transport-related emissions within the member states. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Novel types of sodalite enriched in both K+ and Na+ ions were synthesized from muscovite at different time intervals (24 h (SD-24), 48 (SD-48), and 72 h (SD-72)). The samples displayed changes in their morphologies and observable increment in the surface area, total basicity, and ion exchange capacity with increasing the synthesis period. The samples were used as potential basic catalysts in the transesterification of the waste products of corn oil. The produced sodalite sample after 48 h (SD-48) achieved the best catalytic activity and the best biodiesel yield (95.4%). This yield was obtained after 120 min at 70 C using 16:1 methanol-to corn oil molar ratio and 4 wt., % SD-48 loading. The achieved yields by SD-24 and SD-72 are 84.7% and 90.5%, respectively. The higher activity of SD-48 (95.4%) than SD-24 (84.7%) related to its high surface area and total basicity. The lower activity of SD-72 (90.5%) than SD-48 (95.4%) related to its very high ion exchange capacity which increases the saponification reactions in the existence of K+ and Na+ ions at high concentrations. The used SD-48 catalyst shows significant regeneration belongings and reused in five cycles producing valuable biodiesel yields. Technically, the resulted biodiesel from the waste product of corn oil over SD-48 is of acceptable international qualification which prompts the large-scale use of the catalyst. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper focuses on the evaluation of the fuel properties of Fischer–Tropsch diesel blends with conventional diesel. Incorporating this advanced fuel into conventional diesel production will enable the use of waste materials and non-food materials as resources, while contributing to a reduction in dependence on crude oil. To evaluate the suitability of using Fischer–Tropsch diesel, cetane number, cetane index, CFPP, density, flash point, heat of combustion, lubricity, viscosity, distillation curve, and fuel composition ratios using multidimensional GC × GC-TOFMS for different blends were measured. It was found that the fuel properties of the blended fuel are comparable to conventional diesel and even outperform conventional fuel in some parameters. All measurements were performed according to current standards, thus ensuring the repeatability of measurements for other research groups or the private sector. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of the article is to determine the properties of fuel mixtures of Fischer–Tropsch naphtha fraction with traditional gasoline (petrol) to be able to integrate the production of advanced alternative fuel based on Fischer–Tropsch synthesis into existing fuel markets. The density, octane number, vapor pressure, cloud point, water content, sulphur content, refractive index, ASTM color, heat of combustion, and fuel composition were measured using the gas chromatography method PIONA. It was found that fuel properties of Fischer–Tropsch naphtha fraction is not much comparable to conventional gasoline (petrol) due to the high n-alkane content. This research work recommends the creation of a low-percentage mixture of 3 vol.% of FT naphtha fraction with traditional gasoline to minimize negative effects—similar to the current legislative limit of 5 vol.% of bioethanol in E5 gasoline. FT naphtha fraction as a biocomponent does not contain sulphur or polyaromatic hydro-carbons nor benzene. Waste materials can be processed by FT synthesis. Fischer–Tropsch synthesis can be considered a universal fuel—the naphtha fraction cut can be declared as a biocomponent for gasoline fuel without any further necessary catalytic upgrading. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biofuels are important additives to conventional fuels in combustion engines of the transport sector, as they reduce atmospheric emissions and promote environmental-friendly production chains. The mechanical and thermal performance of a PT6A-61A engine on a test bench of the Colombian Air Force operating with blends of JETA-1 and Biodiesel up to 25% volume values of substitution is evaluated in this work. Experimental results show that blends are operationally reliable up to 15% volume content. In that range, the engine operation is not compromised in terms of response variables. Moreover, experimental properties of fuel blends show that the freezing point—which is the most critical variable, does not comply with aeronautical regulations. The system dynamics are subject to several variations in the test parameters, which mainly affected fuel flow, Inter-Turbine Temperature (ITT), and engine performance. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed over the experimental results to quantify possible disturbances on the bench measurements. This is based on the fact that the study is restrained to stationary test bench conditions. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Jojoba oil biofuel is a potential alternative to diesel fuel with attractive properties, but its flow behavior under the operating conditions of a diesel engine still needs to be clarified. In this study, the rheological properties of the jojoba biofuel are presented in assessment with diesel fuel to experimentally evaluate both their flow behaviors at different operating temperatures. A Fann-type coaxial cylinder viscometer was employed. The shear stress of the tested biofuel rises considerably with the shear rate in a marginally nonlinear manner on a logarithmic scale. Rheograms indicate that the flow behavior decreases gradually and considerably in the temperature range of 30–90◦C. The viscosity of the jojoba oil biofuel declines considerably with the decreasing applied shear rate and temperature. Based on the experimental results, a suitable model is developed for predicting the viscosity characteristics of the tested biofuel during the heating and cooling cycles of a diesel engine. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Bio-oil is a kind of viable renewable and environmentally sustainable energy, which is obtained from fast pyrolysis of biomass. However, bio-oil is not suitable for direct application due to the high content of oxygen and moisture. The upgrading of bio-oil, especially hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil is highly demanded but remains a challenge owing to the absence of efficient and stable catalysts. Herein, an amphiphilic Pd/carbon-silica-alumina catalyst could catalytic reactions at the oil/water interface and simultaneously stabilized the oil/water emulsions, which would be highly advantageous in bio-oil upgrading. Significantly, the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the catalyst could be adjusted by changing the input amount of precursor with resols, tetraethyl orthosilicate and aluminum chloride hexahydrate. In the catalytic reaction, phenol was used as a model bio-oil compound, where decalin and water were used to simulate an oil/water mixed bio-oil system. The as prepared amphipathic Pd/MCSA-24 catalyst showed the highest conversion of phenol (98.0%) and highest selectivity for cyclohexane (87.7%) at 200 °C, which presented great potential in further bio-oil upgrading applications. © 2021

AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms and strains absorb carbon dioxide, drawing attention to its use as feed for animals and renewable energy sources. However, cyanobacteria can produce toxins and have a low heating value. Herein, we studied a cyanobacterial strain harvested during a bloom event and analyzed it to use as animal feed and a source of energy supply. The thermal properties and the contents of total nitrogen, protein, carbohydrate, fatty acids, lipid, and the presence of cyanotoxins were investigated in the Microcystis aeruginosa LTPNA 01 strain and in a bloom material. Microcystins (hepatotoxins) were not detected in this strain nor in the bloom material by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that degradation reactions (devolatilization) initiated at around 180◦C, dropping from approximately 90% to 20% of the samples’ mass. Our work showed that despite presenting a low heating value, both biomass and non-toxic M. aeruginosa LTPNA 01 could be used as energy sources either by burning or producing biofuels. Both can be considered a protein and carbohydrate source similar to some microalgae species as well as biomass fuel. It could also be used as additive for animal feed; however, its safety and potential adverse health effects should be further investigated. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable and sustainable carbon source with great potential for the synthesis of biofuels. In this study fibrous nano-silica (FNS) supported heteropoly acid-functionalized ionic liquid (FNS-ILHPW) catalyst was synthesized for the cross-condensation reaction of 2-MF and 5-MF to produce C16 fuel precursor. 2-MF and 5-MF were utilized in a stoichiometric ratio. The prepared catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The obtained result from the XRD and FTIR suggests that HPW was present as charge compensating anion (H2PW12O40−) of the IL. NH3-TPD analysis revealed that FNS-ILHPW retains moderate to strong acid sites. FNS-ILHPW shows higher conversion of the reactants and selectivity to C16 (2, 2′,2″-methylidenetris[5-methylfuran]) fuel precursor. 95% yield of C16 fuel precursor was obtained over the optimized reaction conditions. The excellent activity can be attributed to the coexistence of HPW, which provides the catalytically active sites, IL groups, which served as anchors of HPW onto the support, and FNS, which improves dispersion of the active sites and accessibility of the reactant molecules through its fibers. The effects of the reaction conditions on the final yield and the carbon balance of the reaction were studied. Furthermore, the catalyst can be effortlessly recovered and reused without appreciable loss of activity. The post reaction characterizations of the spent catalyst show no significant change from the fresh catalyst. © 2021, The Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - This research focuses on deducing the kinetic mechanism for biodiesel production catalyzed by a CaO nanocatalyst derived from waste cockle shells via thermal hydration–dehydration treatment. In addition, the CaO nanocatalyst preparation method via thermal hydration–dehydration-related parameters (hydration duration, recalcination temperature, and recalcination duration) was studied and optimized. The transesterification reaction catalyzed by the CaO nanocatalyst followed the Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic mechanism with surface reaction as the rate-limiting step. The relatively low activation energy (3786.7 J/mol) for a transesterification reaction offered by the CaO nanocatalyst enhanced the reaction rate to 27.3% FAME yield/hr. The optimal conditions for the thermal hydration–dehydration treatment used to develop the nano CaO catalyst were 6 h of hydration duration, 650◦ C of recalcination temperature, and 3 h of recalcination duration. Of biodiesel yield, 94.13% was obtained at a moderate temperature of 60◦ C and 3 h reaction time during the transesterification of palm oil catalyzed by the nano-CaO. SEM, BET, and TPD results proved that the CaO nanocatalyst had a large surface area (13.9113 m2 /g) and high pore volume (0.0318 cm3 /g) that were rich in active sites (1046.46 µmol CO2 /g), and the pore diameter (33.17 nm) was accessible to reactants and products. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, we devised a biofuel cell (BFC) by impregnating sheet-like cellulose nanofiber (CNF) with liquid fuel (fructose) and sandwiching it with the electrodes, making the structure simple and compact. CNF was considered as a suitable material for BFC because it is biocompatible, has a large specific surface area, and exhibits excellent properties as a catalyst and an adsorbent. In this BFC device, graphene-coated carbon fiber woven cloth (GCFC) was used as the material for preparing the electrodes, and the amount of enzyme modification on the surface of each electrode was enhanced. Further, as the distance between the electrodes was same as the thickness of the sheet-shaped CNF, it facilitated the exchange of protons between the electrodes. Moreover, the cathode, which requires an oxidation reaction, was exposed to the atmosphere to enhance the oxygen uptake. The maximum power density of the CNF-type BFC was recorded as 114.5 μW/cm2 at a voltage of 293 mV. This is more than 1.5 times higher than that of the liquid-fuel-type BFC. When measured after 24 h, the maximum power density was recorded as 44.9 μW/cm2 at 236 mV, and the output was maintained at 39% of that observed at the beginning of the measurement. However, it is not the case with general BFCs, where the power generation after 24 h is less than 5%. Therefore, the CNF-type BFCs have a longer lifespan and are fuel efficient. © 2021 Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work demonstrates the application of magnetic carbon‐encapsulated iron nanoparticles (CEINs) for the construction of bioelectrodes in a biobattery and a biofuel cell. It has been shown that carbon‐encapsulated iron nanoparticles are a suitable material for the immobilization of laccase (Lc) and 1,4‐naphthoquinone (NQ) and fructose dehydrogenase (FDH). The system is stable; no leaching of the enzyme and mediator from the surface of the modified electrode was observed. The onset of the catalytic reduction of oxygen to water was at 0.55 V, and catalytic fructose oxidation started at −0.15 V. A biobattery was developed in which a zinc plate served as the anode, and the cathode was a glassy carbon electrode modified with carbon-encapsulated iron nanoparticles, laccase in the Nafion (Nf) layer. The maximum power of the cell was ca. 7 mW/cm2 at 0.71 V and under external resistance of 1 kΩ. The open‐circuit voltage (OCV) for this system was 1.51 V. In the biofuel cell, magnetic nanoparticles were used both on the bioanode and biocathode to immobilize the enzymes. The glassy carbon bioanode was coated with carbon‐encapsulated iron nanoparticles, 1,4‐naphthoquinone, fructose dehydrogenase, and Nafion. The cathode was modified with carbon‐encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles and laccase in the Nafion layer. The biofuel cell parameters were as follows: maximum power of 78 μW/cm2 at the voltage of 0.33 V and under 20 kΩ resistance, and the open‐circuit voltage was 0.49 V. These enzymes worked effectively in the biofuel cell, and laccase also effectively worked in the biobattery. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper proposed to use ferric oxide (Fe2O3) and ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) as catalysts with both microwave absorption and catalytic properties. Carbon dioxide (CO2) was introduced as the reaction atmosphere to further improve the quality of biofuel produced by microwave pyrolysis of food waste (FW). The results showed the bio-gas yield and the syngas concentration (H2 + CO) increased to 70.34 wt% and 61.50 mol%, respectively, using Fe3O4 as the catalyst. The content of aliphatic hydrocarbons in bio-oil produced with the catalyst Fe2O3 increased to 67.48% and the heating value reached 30.45 MJ/kg. Compared with Fe2O3 catalyst, Fe3O4 exhibited better microwave absorption properties and catalytic properties. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characterizations confirmed that the crystal surface of Fe3O4 formed more oxygen vacancy defects and unpaired electrons. Additionally, according to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the content of lattice oxygen in Fe3O4 was 14.11%, a value that was much lower than Fe2O3 (38.54%). The oxygen vacancy defects not only improved the efficient utilization of microwave energy but also provided the reactive sites for the reaction between the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and CO2 to generate CO. This paper provides a new perspective for selecting catalysts that have both microwave absorption and catalytic properties during the microwave pyrolysis of biomass. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Currently, the highly efficient conversion of biomass resources into highly valuable chemicals and biofuels is one of the most prospective approaches to reduce greenhouse gases emission and environmental pollution caused by excess consumption of fossil fuels. Herein, three-dimensional pompon-like well-defined RuCo particles with tunable crystallographic structures and surface atomically dispersed Ru atoms were constructed and intensively investigated as support-free metal catalysts in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin-derived guaiacol. It was demonstrated that the 300 °C-reduced RuCo sample possessed the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystallographic structure with surface abundant atomically dispersed Ru atoms, whereas 600 °C-reduced RuCo sample presented the face-centered cubic phase with lower surface Ru concentration. The as-fabricated RuCo-300 sample showed excellent catalytic HDO activity with a high cyclohexane yield of 85.3%. Comprehensive structural characterizations unveiled that the introduction of atomically dispersed Ru atoms into the RuCo-300 favored the formation of abundant surface Ru-Co sites, as well as electron-rich Ru0, and such-constructed Ru-Co sites were highly beneficial to the hydrogen dissociation on single Ru0 atoms and the further hydrogen spillover to adjacent Co0 atoms to promote the HDO process. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the hcp structure of RuCo catalysts benefited the adsorption of guaiacol. The unique pompon-like microstructure of RuCo catalysts was conducive to the exposure of active sites and provided more open channels for the easy diffusion of reactants and products. Over the RuCo-300 catalyst, the guaiacol HDO could proceed rapidly via an initial demethoxylation reaction. The present Ru-Co synergetic catalysis in the structure of RuCo catalysts would provide a new strategy for constructing robust heterogeneous bimetal catalysts applied in practical HDO processes of a variety of lignin-derived phenolic compounds. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The separation of liquid mixtures has been studied for a long time. Separation is based on the difference in physical properties including pore size and electrostatic interaction. Therefore, there are many difficulties in separation of materials having similar physical properties such as ethanol–water and 1,4-dioxane–water mixtures. While pervaporation based on a difference in transport rates by permeability through a membrane has been suggested, it still has many difficulties such as high energy consumption and huge facilities. Yet there is an existing technical gap to remove trace amounts of organics dissolved in water. Here, a novel separation strategy employing a metamaterial, called meta-separation using the exotic structural property of metamaterials rather than electrostatic characteristics is reported. The structural properties of metamaterials provide various functions of super-hydrophobicity based on roughness of surface, the strong capillary effect based on nanopore, and huge void for great absorption of organics. It exhibits a water contact angle of 151.3° and high adhesive property from nanopore. On the other hand, ethanol is immediately absorbed up to 93 wt%. These differences make it possible to quickly and easily eliminate organics dissolved in water. Furthermore, their applications are expected to achieve functions in environmental remediation, biofuel separation process, etc., without large-scale facilities. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - The consumption of pequi generates a considerable amount of waste (peel) which is not used efficiently. Pyrolysis can be a viable alternative for the use of this food waste, by converting pequi peel into energy in the form of biofuels and compounds of great interest to the chemical industry. This study evaluates the potential of pequi peel waste in the production of bioenergy through pyrolysis and characterization of the obtained products. The biomass was characterized and revealed to be a viable raw material for pyrolysis. From thermogravimetry (TG) data, we determined kinetic parameters according to Friedman's global reaction and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) models, which led to the mean experimental value of activation energy (Ea) of 239.2 and 224.4 kJ mol−1, respectively. The pyrolysis was carried out at 400, 500 and 600 °C, and the highest bio-oil yield (43.6%) was obtained at 500 °C. The classes of compounds quantified in higher amount in the bio-oils were ketones, furans, acids, alcohols and phenols. The bio-oil compounds from pequi peel pyrolysis can be a source of energy and raw materials of great interest for the chemical industry to produce high-added value products. The biochar shows potential for application as adsorbent and solid fuel. The pyrolysis is a feasible process for the pequi peel waste by adding value and reducing the environmental impact caused by the inadequate disposal of lignocellulosic materials. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: A modified TEMPO-catalyzed oxidation of the solvent-exposed glucosyl units of cellulose to uronic acids, followed by carboxyl reduction with NaBD4 to 6-deutero- and 6,6-dideuteroglucosyl units, provided a robust method for determining relative proportions of disordered amorphous, ordered surface chains, and anhydrous core-crystalline residues of cellulose microfibrils inaccessible to TEMPO. Both glucosyl residues of cellobiose units, digested from amorphous chains of cellulose with a combination of cellulase and cellobiohydrolase, were deuterated, whereas those from anhydrous chains were undeuterated. By contrast, solvent-exposed and anhydrous residues alternate in surface chains, so only one of the two residues of cellobiosyl units was labeled. Although current estimates indicate that each cellulose microfibril comprises only 18 to 24 (1 → 4)-β-d-glucan chains, we show here that microfibrils of walls of Arabidopsis leaves and maize coleoptiles, and those of secondary wall cellulose of cotton fibers and poplar wood, bundle into much larger macrofibrils, with 67 to 86% of the glucan chains in the anhydrous domain. These results indicate extensive bundling of microfibrils into macrofibrils occurs during both primary and secondary wall formation. We discuss how, beyond lignin, the degree of bundling into macrofibrils contributes an additional recalcitrance factor to lignocellulosic biomass for enzymatic or chemical catalytic conversion to biofuel substrates.

AB  - Before biobased fuels can replace fossil fuels, several key issues must be addressed. Bio-oils derived through pyrolysis of lignocellulosic material have high acidity and viscosity, and poor energy density and stability. To address these issues, this paper examines the individual and combined behavior of lignocellulosic feedstock components to shed light on the potential to generate preferential biofuel properties through biomass mixing. Dry lignocellulosic biomass is mostly composed of cell wall polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin), which vary widely in type and concentration across biomasses. This heterogeneity leads to increased unpredictability in biobased fuel formation during pyrolysis. Using derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and residual gas analysis, this work explores the synergistic interactions of lignocellulosic biomass components during pyrolysis to manipulate bio-oil and gas product composition based on desired compound classes. Cellulose, xylose, xylan, and lignin were blended at different ratios to determine the extent of synergistic effects during pyrolysis. For each mixture, an ‘expected’ outcome was developed by summing the individual behavior (e.g. mass loss rate, H2 gas evolution, etc.) of the individual components based on mass fraction present. Mixtures containing lignin and/or xylan yield peak DTG mass loss rates at lower temperatures than predicted with corresponding reductions in biochar yield suggesting synergistic interactions that promote devolatilization. By itself, lignin produces large amounts of hydrogen gas, and when mixed with other biomasses promotes dehydrogenation. Lignin increases CO2 formation, resulting in lower oxygen concentrations in the bio-oil and biochar. While suppressing bio-oil generation, the presence of lignin – even at low concentrations – increases the number of phenol compounds produced, while decreasing the yield of furans. The synergistic interactions between different polysaccharides could be exploited depending on the desired biorefinery products – allowing for targeted selection of lignocellulosic biomass mixes to fine-tune resulting fuels. © 2021

AB  - The direct conversion of inedible oil to produce the second-generation of biofuel is a promising technology. In this study, Pt/SAPO-11 catalyst was synthesized, and it was further modified by Sn. Two typical inedible oils (Jatropha oil and waste lard oil) were used as feedstocks. The liquid yield, deoxygenation rate, selectivity of alkanes, and selectivity of iso-alkanes were studied. It is shown that the selectivity of alkanes and iso-alkanes increase simultaneously over Pt-Sn/SAPO-11. The selectivity of C8-C16 alkanes and iso-alkanes from Jatropha oil is 69.82 % and 39.30 %. In the case of waste lard oil, there were 64.42 % selectivity of C15-C18 alkanes and 50.05 % selectivity of C15-C18 iso-alkanes. Pt-Sn/SAPO-11 catalyst remains a higher hydrotreating activity and stability during the 72 h test. The addition of Sn not only decreases the particle size of Pt, but also leads to a strong interaction between Pt and SAPO-11. Sn modified Pt/SAPO-11 has much weak Lewis acid sites. Increase of Lewis acid sites and total acid sites enhance isomerization selectivity and deoxygenation rate simultaneously. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is commonly produced via transesterification process, usually through the use of batch type reactor. There are significant gaps in batch reactor technologies, where the importance of operating conditions are often concluded based on the steady-state conditions. In this study, a Pareto-Hierarchical framework were employed, based on results of a 4-factor 3-level full factorial Design of Experiments. Four parameters of interest such as agitation speed, catalyst loading, methanol-to-oil ratio, and temperature, were firsts analysed using transient Pareto approach followed by hierarchical clustering. The results indicate that low methanol: oil ratio favours transesterification at the beginning, with increasing importance as the process proceeds. From it, the magnitude of standardised effect increases from 0.38 to 14.21, representing an over 37-fold improvement. Conversely, agitation speed showed a reduction of 37-fold in standardised effect throughout the transesterification process, plateauing around mid-way of the reaction. Catalyst loading and temperature shared similar trends, as they influence the activation energy. Their standardised effects peak at 180 s which is in the middle of the physical-limiting regime. Therefore, this study provides a framework to develop an analyses to make dynamic optimisation strategy better in terms of economics and yield efficiency. © 2021

AB  - The heavy utilization of fossil fuels and efforts to reduce carbon footprint worldwide led to the development of biofuels. Therefore, this paper investigates the kinetic study for the catalytic cracking reaction of refined rubber seed oil (RSO) for bio gasoline production using Cu/ZSM5 catalyst. The reaction was carried out at 440 ᵒC and at atmospheric condition within the WHSV range of 1.5–3.5 h−1 in a fixed bed reactor. The kinetic rate constants were estimated based on 3, 4 and 5 lumped models sequentially. In the 3-lump model, the RSO was converted mostly to organic liquid product (OLP) and only forming some undesired gas and coke. Both refined RSO and OLP contributed to the formation of gas and coke products in the 4-lump model. In the 5-lump model, the RSO and OLP both favoured gasoline production. The absence of gaseous product suggests that no secondary cracking reactions occurred in gasoline fractions, but coke deposition was formed due to condensation. The high R2 squared values suggest that the predicted model data was in good agreement with the experimental data. © 2021

AB  - There is increasing interest in recovering nutrients and energy from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). Given the costs associated with separate collection of OFMSW, and the potential difficulty in finding clean feedstocks, there are potential benefits in beneficial recovery of OFMSW as part of residual MSW. Therefore, this study compared the life-cycle impacts associated with management alternatives for recovering energy and/or nutrients from the OFMSW through mixed waste processing systems. The considered treatment alternatives include landfilling, mass burn waste-to-energy, gasification and syngas combustion (GC) for electricity production, gasification Fischer–Tropsch (GFT) for transportation fuel production, aerobic composting (AC), and anaerobic digestion (AD). Seven environmental impacts include global warming potential (GWP), cumulative energy demand, acidification, eutrophication, photochemical oxidation, ecotoxicity, and human toxicity were assessed for five sets of state and one U.S. national waste compositions. The mass burn waste-to-energy and GC scenarios generally have the lowest environmental impacts, while landfilling and GFT have the greatest impacts. Separating out organics for AC increased environmental impacts compared to sending them to GC, while sending them to AD decreased GWP and increased the other impacts. Sensitivity analyses suggest that these conclusions are generally robust to uncertainty in input values. © 2021

AB  - The cyanobacterial phycobiliproteins (PBPs) are an important natural colorant for nutraceutical industries. Here, a multi-objective hybrid machine learning-based optimization approach was used for enhanced cell biomass and PBPs production simultaneously in Nostoc sp. CCC-403. A central composite design (CCD) was employed to design an experimental setup for four input parameters, including three BG-11 medium components and pH. We achieved a 61.76% increase in total PBPs production and an almost 90% increase in cell biomass by our prediction model. We also established a test genome-scale metabolic network (GSMN) for Nostoc sp. and identified potential metabolic fluxes contributing to PBPs enhanced production. This study highlights the advantage of the hybrid machine learning approach and GSMN to achieve optimization for more than one objective and serves as the foundation for future efforts to convert cyanobacteria as an economically viable source for biofuels and natural products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Utilization of the enhanced Spent Residue Fluid Catalytic Cracking (SRFCC) catalysts through the acid treatment was conducted for the palm oil hydrocracking process to produce biofuels. The catalysts were characterized using Pyridine-probed Fourier Transform Infrared (Pyridine-FTIR) spectroscopy and Brunauer−Emmett−Teller-Barrett−Joyner−Halenda (BET-BJH) method. The higher number of Brønsted acid sites on the enhanced SRFCC catalysts leads to the lower conversion of palm oil as well as lower deoxygenation activity because of the slower carbocations formation process as the initiation reaction. On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites on the enhanced SRFCC catalysts have a significant role in the deoxygenation reaction mechanism. Meanwhile, the catalysts surface area and pore size are responsible for tailoring the diffusion mechanism of the mass transfer process of reactant molecules. The introduction of hydrogen gas in the reaction system has a significant role in deoxygenation, double bond cleavage, and de-coking process mechanisms. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To develop a method for direct transesterification of wet yeast using immobilized lipase, the oleaginous yeast Saitozyma podzolica Zwy-2-3 and the lipase producing Burkholderia pyrrolica WZ10-3 were used as materials for production of biodiesel. Fe3O4@SiO2-CHO prepared by modifying Fe3O4 with TEOS, APTES and glutaraldehyde. The biocatalysts covalently cross-linked with WZ10-3 lipase by Fe3O4@SiO2-CHO were characterized by FTIR, XRD and TEM. When the enzyme dosage, glutaraldehyde concentration, temperature and time were 30.22 mL, 2.0%, 40 °C and 4 h, the immobilized lipase activity and immobilization rate reached 10038.0 U/g and 96.9%, respectively. The optimum temperatures for immobilized and free lipase were 60 °C and 40 °C. The immobilized enzyme still had 80% enzymatic activity after 48 d storage at 4 °C. The optimized conditions for the direct conversion of immobilized lipase to esterified wet yeast (one-step) were: enzyme dosage 2.5 g, reaction temperature 35 °C; water content 15%; and molar ratio of n-hexane to methanol 3: 1. The transesterification rates of one-step method for oil and biomass were 98.12% and 56.11%, respectively. In contrast, the two-step method was only 88.75% and 51.21%. The immobilized enzyme had 90% enzyme activity after 10 times of reuse. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - New generations of biofuels innovative combined (bio-)waste resources of spent coffee grounds (SCGs), chopsticks, and polypropylene (PP) spoons were successfully achieved in this study. The SCG pellets were compressed at load force of 40 kgf/cm2 for 3 min and torrefied for 1 h at 300 °C during the manufacturing processes. The highest heating value of the sample was 26.21 MJ/kg with 50% SCGs, 20% chopsticks, and 30% PP spoons. The solid yields of chopsticks and PP spoons were ca. 2.45% (w/w) and 3.35% (w/w) when increasing 10% of the waste utensils, respectively. The content of the fixed carbon was in a range of 17-34.68% in the SCG samples. Mixing chopsticks is helpful for increasing fixed carbon content, and PP spoons is helpful for increasing heating values of the biofuels. The TGA results found that decreasing SCG contents increased weight loss of the samples within experimental period. The SEM images showed an incorporation of SCG with waste utensils formed a homogeneous and continuous surface with a good compatibility. The SCG samples manufactured in this study had higher carbon contents (70.40-78.34%) than previous studies of SCGs. Using PP utensils did not contribute chlorine contents (0%) but small contribution of sulfur (0.41%) and chlorine (0.10%) contents of the samples were from chopsticks. The results of this study are useful for reducing wastes and creating renewable energy in the modern energy demanded world. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

First-generation biorefineries bear the stigma of using arable land and edible crops for fuel instead of as sources of food and feed. However, second-generation biorefineries have not reached the level of full technical feasibility. Bearing in mind the objective of sugar production from sugar, starch, or lignocellulosic raw materials, the purpose of this study is to assess the environmental impact of first- and second-generation biorefineries, considering as an example for the comparative evaluation, the production of sugar fractions from crops (starch and sugar crops), and lignocellulosic biomass (hardwood and softwood). The characterization results were obtained using the ReCiPe 1.1 model, implemented through the SimaPro 9.0 software. Both production systems are inherently different and have strengths and weaknesses that must be carefully analyzed. The resulting environmental profile shows that the silviculture of wood contributes less to the environmental impact than cropping activities in most impact categories. In general, this study suggests that first-generation systems are burdened environmentally by the use of fertilizers, which have a significant impact on categories such as marine and freshwater eutrophication and terrestrial acidification, while second-generation systems are limited by the intensive processing steps needed for delignification, typically involving the use of chemicals and/or energy. LCA in early stages of the production of bio-based building blocks, rather than on the manufacture of biofuels or bioplastics, allows the precise identification of the environmental burdens that may be influencing the overall environmental profile of a biorefinery. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Furfurylamine is an important furfural-upgrading biobased chemical for the production of pharmaceuticals, biofuels, fibers, additives, polymers, etc. In one-pot reaction system, biomass was tandemly catalyzed to furfurylamine with aluminium-based alkaline-treated graphite (Al-AG) catalyst and recombinant ω-transaminase biocatalyst. Al-AG (3.6 wt%) catalyzed corncob (75.0 g/L) to 110.0 mM furfural at 56.8% yield (based on xylan in corncob) in γ-valerolactone–water (1:4, v:v; pH 1.0) for 40 min at 180 °C. The pH-adjusted corncob-slurry (pH 7.5) containing furfural were catalyzed to furfurylamine at high yield with γ-valerolactone-tolerant Aspergillus terreus ω-transaminase biocatalyst at 35 °C using isopropylamine (3 mol isopropylamine/mol furfural) as amine donor. Such an efficient and sustainable approach for catalytic conversion of biomass to high-value-added biobased furfurylamine was successfully established in tandem reaction with Al-AG and ω-transaminase biocatalyst.

AB  - The present work concerns the conversion of coconut oil into hydrocarbons within the chain length range of jet biofuel through the pathway called hydroprocessing of esters and fatty acids (HEFA). The aim is to employ the resulting mixture as an alternative biofuel in the aviation sector. The process involved two steps: (i) hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) over a sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst, followed by (ii) hydroisomerization (HIS) over a Pt/SAPO-11 catalyst. Preliminary tests were carried out with model compounds: lauric acid and n-dodecane for HDO and HIS, respectively. In both steps, middle processing temperatures (~ 340–350 °C) were low enough to prevent excessive cracking but high enough to provide acceptable reaction rates and to prevent coke formation. The HDO step rendered a mixture constituted basically by n-alkanes. The subsequent HIS permitted to increase the content of branched chains. The final HEFA-SPK (where SPK is the abbreviation for synthetic paraffinic kerosene) had an acidic index zero and a relatively high content of monomethylalkanes. Furthermore, due to the fatty chain composition of the starting oil, the chain length distribution of the resulting biofuel matched well with that of conventional jet fuels, so that subsequent steps of cracking and fractionation, which increase costs and reduce the process yield, were not required. The obtained results are encouraging in terms of using coconut oil-based HEFA-SPK in the formulation of sustainable alternative jet fuels at competitive costs and with relevant environmental and social benefits. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising technology for microalgae-based biofuel production. However, hydrothermal liquefaction's aqueous wastes have little established reuse, and contain significant fractions of toxic ammoniacal nitrogen. Careful reuse of this waste can assure microalgae-based biofuels are produced with less environmental impact and larger energy efficiency. Microbial electrolysis cells were investigated to valorize this waste product by converting the leftover organics into hydrogen and remove ammonia. Waste hydrothermal liquefaction aqueous phase from two microalgal strains, Tetraselmis sp. and Chlorella sp. were used as feedstocks for hydrogen production in microbial electrolysis cells. Chlorella and Tetraselmis aqueous phase-fed microbial electrolysis cells reach an average current density of 5.1 ± 0.19 A/m2 and 3.8 ± 0.08 A/m2. Compound removal rates and mass removal percentages were also investigated for each feedstock. Acetic acid, propionic acid, ethanol, and glycerol were effectively removed from the aqueous byproduct. Further, microbial electrolysis cells separated up to 34.3% of ammoniacal nitrogen present in the aqueous phase. Charge transfer analysis indicated that proton transfer, not ammonium transfer, contributed to the majority of the hydrogen production in the cathode. Finally, the microbial electrolysis cell effluent was reused to grow the same microalgal strains, leading to the development of a circular biofuel production system. Microalgae regrowth studies using microbial electrolysis cell effluent showed nearly complete removal of total organic carbon, but significantly less removal of total nitrogen. Tetraselmis sp. growth occurred with the Tetraselmis-derived MEC effluent, however, the control medium without effluent produced the most growth. These findings support the possibility of a circular biofuel framework using MECs, but additional constraints, including the removal of inorganic contaminants, are necessary to realize the circular processes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The diversity of biomass and its conversion processes produce a diverse pool of functional molecules. For many of these molecules, property data have not been measured yet and need to be estimated to determine suitability to a particular application. For example, viscosity is a key property in the development of green solvents, fuel additives, and biofuels. This paper proposes the use of modularity as a molecular descriptor combined with functional group counts to estimate molecular properties using neural network models. The modularity of molecules was determined from graph representations using community detection algorithms. The potential for this approach was demonstrated for the modeling of viscosity at 25 °C and applied to biomass-derived molecules. The model performances showed that including modularity contributed to more accurate estimations than viscosity models existing in the literature. Furthermore, modularity on its own can be useful to estimate viscosity for n-alkanes, esters, isoalkanes, aldehydes, aromatics, and cycloalkanes. This was due to the capacity of modularity to capture the structural features of the molecules employed in the data set. As such, modularity exhibited its tremendous potential to be exploited for property estimation, supporting the screening, rational design, and engineering of green chemicals derived from biomass. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The conversion of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (5-HMF) into 2,5-dimethylfuran (2,5-DMF) via cascade hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis over metallic catalysts has been considered a promising method to produce high-energy-content biofuel. Understanding the adsorption of reactants, cascade reactions, and desorption of byproducts is essential for developing efficient and selective catalysts. Herein, the most plausible reaction mechanisms for the conversion of 5-HMF to 2,5-DMF over the Pd(111), Cu(111), and Cu3Pd(111) surfaces are investigated using density functional theory calculations. The reaction pathways for the formation of reaction intermediates (2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan, 5-methylfurfural, and 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol (5-MFA)), 2,5-DMF, and byproducts (water, 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (2,5-DMTHF)) are established. The overall reaction barrier on the Pd(111) surface, which is governed by the hydrogenolysis of the C-OH bonds in 5-MFA, is larger (1.96 eV) than that on the Cu3Pd(111) surface (1.68 eV). In addition, the significantly higher adsorption energy of 2,5-DMF on the Pd(111) surface (-2.47 eV) than on the Cu3Pd(111) surface (-0.18 eV), which is caused by the flat adsorption geometry with a η2-(C-O)-aldehyde configuration, leads to the formation of 2,5-DMTHF via furan ring saturation. Even though the overall energy barrier on the Cu(111) surface (0.84 eV) is much lower than those on the Pd(111) and Cu3Pd(111) surfaces, the weak perpendicular adsorption of 5-HMF in a η1-(O)-aldehyde configuration, highly unfavorable dissociative H2 adsorption, and high energy required for the formation of H2O hinder the conversion of 5-HMF and its intermediates. The favorable adsorption of 5-HMF (-0.54 eV), low overall reaction barrier, facile desorption of 2.5-DMF (-0.18 eV), and low energy barrier for dissociative H2 adsorption render the Pd-Cu alloy catalyst a promising candidate for the selective conversion of 5-HMF to 2,5-DMF. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A three-liquid-phase system (TLPS) was developed and used as a novel enzymatic one-pot multistep reaction (EOMR) system. In this system, lipase and phospholipase were enriched in a single liquid phase with a high recovery (ca. 98%) and then used for the simultaneous catalysis of mutually inhibiting and interfering reactions (hydrolysis of phospholipids and glyceride in crude oil). A novel emulsion containing the two dispersed droplets (W2/O/W2 and W1/W2 emulsion structures) could be the key reason for this phenomenon because the emulsion system not only provided a new catalytic interface but also relieved the product inhibition. As a result, the content of free fatty acid (main hydrolysate of the glyceride) and the removal of phospholipid from the crude oil could be increased to 96 and 95%, respectively, within 1 h. The product obtained from the EOMR was directly used in the production of biodiesel via enzymatic esterification, and the content of fatty acid methanol ester could be increased to 93% within 2 h. Furthermore, the enzymes in the middle phase could also be reused, at least for eight rounds without significant loss in catalytic efficiency. Therefore, the TLPS could be considered as an ideal catalytic platform for the EOMR. ©

AB  - In the present study, catalytic fast pyrolysis of waste mixed cloth in an ex-situ method using hierarchical HZSM and commercial CaO was investigated. Pyrolysis of waste mixed cloth in a temperature range of 450 °C to 750 °C mainly allowed for the formation of levoglucosan without any catalysts. The utilization of HZSM with Brønsted/Lewis acid sites on micro- and mesoporous structures significantly contributed to monocyclic/dicyclic chemicals production, mainly referring to monoaromatics and naphthalene-based derivatives, especially in the case of high heating rates and catalyst usages. Furthermore, CaO revealed strong deoxygenation performance for the transformation of waste mixed cloth into low oxygen-containing chemicals, such as ketones, aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatics. The present research thus highlights a feasible route for the catalytic upgrading of waste mixed cloth into some kinds of value-added chemicals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) biocrude is a promising source of energy with potential for co-processing with conventional fuels or as a drop-in fuel. However, it needs upgrading to reduce heteroatoms (e.g., N, S, O), improve physical properties, stability, and miscibility with hydrocarbons. Distillation is a conventional physical upgrading method that has not been studied extensively for biocrude using an industry-accepted procedure on a large scale. In this study, an algae-based biocrude was distilled into four fractions using ASTM D2892 standard method: Fraction 1 (<100°C), Fraction 2 (100-175 °C), Fraction 3 (175-275 °C), and Fraction 4 (275-350 °C). The column has 15 theoretical stages, so it is realistic for large scale production. Algae-based biocrude is rich in nitrogen and sulphur content, which causes NOx and SOx emissions contribute to acid rain and soot formation, poisons the upgrading catalysts. Distillation decreased the nitrogen content of all fractions by 18.1 – 91.0%, and a similar reduction in sulphur (up to 71.2%) and oxygen content (up to 15.2%) was also observed in the heavy fractions. Fractional distillation reduced the viscosity and density of biocrude fractions making the fractionated fuel more similar to diesel, which increases the potential for applications either in co-processing or as a drop-in fuel for diesel engines. Stability tests for ten weeks’ storage in three different conditions (4 ℃, 15-33 ℃ and 43 ℃) revealed distillate fractions were far more stable in terms of chemical structure, viscosity, and higher heating value. Miscibility and blending stability tests showed that the miscibility of the distillates mixture (DistMix) was greatly improved due to the reduction in heteroatoms. In addition, the blend was stable after one-month in storage, which all assists potential for co-processing. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fruit waste collected from a juice factory was pyrolyzed over zeolite catalysts with different pore topologies. The production of aromatic compounds was directly influenced by zeolite topology type (i.e. pore opening size and pore channel dimensionality). Zeolites with three-dimensional (3D) pore topologies (e.g. MFI, BEA and FAU) favored aromatization reactions, which yielded up to 80% aromatic compounds, compared to <20% yield in the pyrolysis over FER and MOR zeolites with two- and one-dimensional pore channels, respectively. The catalytic performance of the 3D zeolites, MFI, BEA and FAU were more vulnerable to operating conditions such as catalyst to biomass ratio and pyrolysis temperature, compared to 2D FER and 1D MOR zeolites. The results were possibly explained by the interplays of diffusion limitations and space constrains, imposed by the pore topologies. By correlation analysis, applying FAU zeolite at catalyst to biomass ratio of 2:1 under 450, 550, or 650 °C was found to be optimal for aromatics formation, affording more mono aromatic hydrocarbons (45%) and less polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (30%). Moreover, the zeolites employed in the reactions with larger pore size tended to coke. This work potentially provides a guideline for efficient conversion of fruit waste to aromatic compounds enriched biofuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A new process for the production of bioethanol from paper mill sludge (PMS) is described in this work. PMS biomass feedstock was processed via the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) with and without accelerants. The enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation were first evaluated, and the energy demand was 2.2 MJ/L of produced ethanol. When the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation were combined, the energy demand was reduced to 1.0 MJ/L ethanol, the sugars production increased, and the overall capital cost of the process decreased. The sugar yield was improved by adding accelerant and selecting the optimal fiber recovery method. The accelerant improved the enzymatic hydrolysis via a pathing/bridging mechanism. The SSF with the chemical fiber recovery method coupled with accelerant addition would be the best process configuration. Upon this combination, the glucose profile was enhanced from 9.8 g/L to 17.0 g/L. The sludge fiber conversion by SSF was improved by selecting an efficient fiber recovery method combined with the accelerant addition. SSF in chemical fiber recovery with accelerant addition was the best process by a 10% improvement of ethanol yield. The proposed process configuration offers a lower cost and sustainable process and contributes to the circular economy of zero waste discharges. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Upgrading fatty acids to hydrocarbons via deoxygenation is significant for the synthesis of high-grade biofuels. Developing economic reaction conditions without using noble metal-based catalysts in the absence of hydrogen and solvent has promising application prospects. Herein, carbon-coated bimetallic FeNi nanoparticles were prepared via an in-situ carbonization-reduction strategy using double-metal cyanide at different temperatures for the deoxygenation of stearic acid. The size of the alloy core and the thickness of the carbon shell were found to be easily adjusted by varying temperature. Compared with monometallic Fe/C and Ni/C catalysts, the alloy catalyst exhibits an obvious improvement in both the conversion of stearic acid and the selectivity of heptadecane. ATR-IR spectra show that the insertion of the inert Fe element into Ni nanoparticles can promote carboxylic acid group adsorption but restrain hydrocarbon group adsorption. The synergistic effect of Fe and Ni elements leads to the promotion of direct decarboxylation of stearic acid and suppression of the C–C cracking reaction. Among different alloy catalysts studied, FeNi@C-800 exhibits the greatest catalytic performance with a 99.9% conversion of stearic acid and 76.8% selectivity for heptadecane. Furthermore, the catalyst can still maintain a stable catalytic performance against the leaching and ripening of metal through the protection afforded by the carbon shell. This work not only provides a powerful reaction system for the decarboxylation of stearic acid but also demonstrates an alternative catalyst to noble metals based on a convenient carbonization-reduction strategy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this experimental study, a novel combustion technique, "reactivity-controlled compression ignition"(RCCI), has been investigated using alcohols acting as low-reactivity fuel (LRF) and mineral diesel acting as high-reactivity fuel (HRF). Combustion experiments were performed in a single-cylinder research engine at a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm and a low engine load of 3 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP). RCCI combustion is a practical low-temperature combustion (LTC) concept, which was achieved using three primary alcohols: Methanol, Ethanol, and Butanol in different premixed ratios (rp = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) with mineral diesel. Results showed a relatively superior performance and emissions characteristics of RCCI combustion than the conventional compression ignition (CI) combustion. The influence of LRF was visible in the RCCI combustion, which exhibited a more stable combustion than the baseline CI combustion. Retarded start of combustion (SoC) with increasing rp was exhibited by all alcohols; however, this trend was more dominant for Methanol/diesel- and Ethanol/diesel-fueled RCCI combustion. The presence of moisture traces in Ethanol was clearly observed in Ethanol/diesel-fueled RCCI combustion. Butanol/diesel-fueled RCCI combustion showed more significant similarity with conventional CI combustion at the lower rp. RCCI combustion-fueled with different alcohols produced relatively lower emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx); however, hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were higher than that of baseline CI combustion. Among different alcohols, Methanol/diesel and Ethanol/diesel showed a higher reduction in particulate matter (PM) emissions than the Butanol/diesel-fueled RCCI combustion. At higher rp, particulate characteristics of RCCI combustion were similar to that of spark ignition (SI) engines. Correlation between the total particulate mass (TPM) and the NOx emissions showed a strong possibility of significant emission reduction by employing RCCI combustion in the engines while ensuring energy diversification and use of biofuels in an efficient manner. © 2021 SAE International.

AB  - Many concerns, such as economic and technical viability and social and ethical aspects, must be considered for a feedstock selection for advanced biofuels. Industrialized countries promote the use of industrial waste or by-products for this purpose. In particular, turpentine has several properties which make it an attractive source for biofuels, including its possible industrial waste origin. Nevertheless, turpentine has shown some disadvantages when blended directly with diesel, especially because it increases the sooting tendency. On the contrary, some derivatives of turpentine can be suitable for diesel blends. Thus, the evaluation of their properties is necessary. In the present work, the properties of hydrogenated and oxyfunctionalized turpentine have been analysed and compared with the purpose of elucidating their benefits and drawbacks in diesel fuel applications, using European standards as a reference. The results show a promising application of both hydroturpentine and oxyturpentine as diesel components. While hydroturpentine significantly improves the diesel cold flow properties, oxyturpentine noticeably reduces the sooting tendency. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In this paper, a multiperiod, multiobjective, and multiproduct second-generation biodiesel supply chain network is innovated, taking into account sustainable development and international resources and demand. The proposed model maximizes the total profit and positive social issues and minimizes the harmful environmental consequences of the network. Furthermore, as trade is nowadays considered to be an important issue on an international scale, economic globalization is also considered in the present study by expanding the operational activities of supplying feedstocks and selling final products worldwide. The model is validated through real data collected within Iran and some Asian countries and solved by the interactive fuzzy programming method. The experimental results verify the efficiency of the model for countries that have the capacity to produce inedible-based biofuel. As a result, the highest share of the revenues is earmarked for international biodiesel sales (80%), which indicates that globalization can increase the profit to a great extent. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The aim of the present work was focused on optimising the yield and quality of the biocrude obtained by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Nannochloropsis gaditana. Temperature, reaction time and microalga concentration were the variables used to carry out an experimental factorial design with a central composite design. The responses chosen were the biocrude yield and the nitrogen and oxygen content in the biocrude phase. A second-order model was obtained to predict the responses as a function of these variables. Temperature is the most determining factor with a positive influence on biocrude yield. The maximum biocrude yield (42.3 ± 0.8 wt%) was obtained at 320◦C, 10 min of reaction and 10 wt% microalgae concentration, and the nitrogen and oxygen content significantly decreased with respect to their corresponding levels in the initial microalgal biomass. The HHV value of the biocrude was 35.7 MJ/kg. The biocrude was composed of 30% of linear and branched hydrocarbons. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Hollow ZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al molar ratios and hierarchical porous shell were fabricated via employing dissolution-recrystallization strategy, and utilized as support to load precious Pt (Pt/HZ-x) for hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol to cycloalkanes. The physicochemical properties of the as-synthesized catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray crystalline diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM), field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM), nitrogen adsorption and desorption (N2-BET), ammonia temperature program desorption (NH3-TPD) and X-ray photoelectron energy spectroscopy (XPS). Benefit from the special hollow structure, hollow ZSM-5 zeolites exhibited a larger external specific surface area and mesoporous volume, which was favorable to promote the dispersion of metallic Pt and mass transfer of reactants. The Pt/HZ-x catalysts showed excellent catalytic performance and hydrodeoxygenation activity for guaiacol, and could reach 100% selectivity to cycloalkanes at a low temperature of 220℃. In addition, as the acidity of the molecular sieve carrier weakens, the degree of secondary reaction of the guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation product decreases, which increased the selectivity to cyclohexane. © 2021, Editorial Board of CIESC Journal.

AB  - The article presents the results of research on the influence of two fuel additives that selectively affect the combustion process in a diesel engine cylinder. The addition of NitrON® reduces the concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx), due to a reduction in the kinetic combustion rate, at the cost of a slight increase in the concentration of particulate matter (PM) in the engine exhaust gas. The Reduxco® additive reduces PM emissions by increasing the diffusion combustion rate, while slightly increasing the NOx concentration in the engine exhaust gas. Research conducted by the authors confirmed that the simultaneous use of both of these additives in the fuel not only reduced both NOx and PM emissions in the exhaust gas but additionally the reduction of NOx and PM emissions was greater than the sum of the effects of these additives—the synergy effect. Findings indicated that the waveforms of the heat release rate (dQ/dα) responsible for the emission of NOx and PM in the exhaust gas differed for the four tested fuels in relation to the maximum value (selectively and independently in the kinetic and diffusion stage), and they were also phase shifted. Due to this, the heat release process Q(α) was characterized by a lower amount of heat released in the kinetic phase compared to fuel with NitrON® only and a greater amount of heat released in the diffusion phase compared to fuel with Reduxco® alone, which explained the lowest NOx and PM emissions in the exhaust gas at that time. For example for the NOx concentration in the engine exhaust: the Nitrocet® fuel additive (in the used amount of 1500 ppm) reduces the NOx concentration in the exhaust gas by 18% compared to the base fuel. The addition of a Reduxco® catalyst to the fuel (1500 ppm) unfortunately increases the NOx concentration by up to 20%. On the other hand, the combustion of the complete tested fuel, containing both additives simultaneously, is characterized, thanks to the synergy effect, by the lowest NOx concentration (reduction by 22% in relation to the base). For example for PM emissions: the Nitrocet® fuel additive does not significantly affect the PM emissions in the engine exhaust (up to a few per cent compared to the base fuel). The addition of a Reduxco® catalyst to the fuel greatly reduces PM emissions in the engine exhaust, up to 35% compared to the base fuel. On the other hand, the combustion of the complete tested fuel containing both additives simultaneously is characterized by the synergy effect with the lowest PM emission (reduction of 39% compared to the base fuel). © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Acacia mangium is a widely grown tree species across the forests in Brunei Darussalam, posing a threat to the existence of some native species in Brunei Darussalam. These species produce large quantities of lignocellulosic biomass from the tree parts comprising the phyllodes, trunk, bark, twigs, pods, and branches. This study examined the thermochemical characteristics and pyrolytic conversion behavior of these tree parts to assess the possibility of valorization to yield bioenergy. Proximate, ultimate, heating value, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses were performed to assess the thermochemical characterization, while thermogravimetric analysis was conducted to examine the pyrolytic degradation behavior. Proximate analysis revealed a moisture content, volatile, fixed carbon, and ash contents of 7.88–11.65 wt.%, 69.82–74.85 wt.%, 14.47–18.31 wt.%, and 1.41–2.69 wt.%, respectively. The heating values of the samples were reported in a range of 19.51–21.58 MJ/kg on a dry moisture basis, with a carbon content in the range of 45.50– 50.65 wt.%. The FTIR analysis confirmed the heterogeneous nature of the biomass samples with the presence of multiple functional groups. The pyrolytic thermal degradation of the samples occurred in three major stages from the removal of moisture and light extractives, hemicellulose and cellulose decomposition, and lignin decomposition. The bio‐oil yield potential from the biomass samples was reported in the range of 40 to 58 wt. %, highlighting the potential of Acacia mangium biomass for the pyrolysis process. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Through the previous study a hydrothermal polymerization (HTP)—a catalytic methodology for treating various biomass and organic wastes—has been developed on a lab scale with a 1 L reactor and the results published. The research work described herein aims to ensure that the catalytic process is scalable for pilot and even commercial scale plants. A 1700 L binary reactor system has been built and the assumptions of a commercial scale plant that would have 10,000 to 20,000 L pressure vessels tested. The HTP catalytic biofuel process converts mono-and polysaccharides into a solid polymer fuel that is based on a furfuraldehyde ring system. The calorific value of the material obtained from the pilot plant is on the order of 27 MJ/kg and the material typically has low ash and fixed carbon content order of 48% which are about same as the lab results for various wood biomass feedstocks. Though a 1700 times scale up binary reactor system the scalability of the HTP catalytic methodology has been confirmed and the mass and energy balance of the binary reactor identified in order to provide fundamental data for commercial scale establishment in future. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Second-generation biofuel production is in high demand, but lignocellulosic biomass’ complexity impairs its use due to the vast diversity of enzymes necessary to execute the complete saccharification. In nature, lignocellulose can be rapidly deconstructed due to the division of biochemical labor effectuated in bacterial communities. Here, we analyzed the lignocellulolytic potential of a bacterial consortium obtained from soil and dry straw leftover from a sugarcane milling plant. This consortium was cultivated for 20 weeks in aerobic conditions using sugarcane bagasse as a sole carbon source. Scanning electron microscopy and chemical analyses registered modification of the sugarcane fiber’s appearance and biochemical composition, indicating that this consortium can deconstruct cellulose and hemicellulose but no lignin. A total of 52 metagenome-assembled genomes from eight bacterial classes (Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Bacteroidia, Cytophagia, Gammaproteobacteria, Oligoflexia, and Thermoleophilia) were recovered from the consortium, in which ~46% of species showed no relevant modification in their abundance during the 20 weeks of cultivation, suggesting a mostly stable consortium. Their CAZymes repertoire indicated that many of the most abundant species are known to deconstruct lignin (e.g., Chryseobacterium) and carry sequences related to hemicellulose and cellulose deconstruction (e.g., Chitinophaga, Niastella, Niabella, and Siphonobacter). Taken together, our results unraveled the bacterial diversity, enzymatic potential, and effectiveness of this lignocellulose-decomposing bacterial consortium. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Extracellular and cell-bound lipase-producing yeasts were isolated from the palm oil mill wastes and investigated for their potential uses as biocatalysts in biodiesel production. Twenty-six yeast strains were qualitatively screened as lipase producers. From those yeast strains, only six were selected and screened further for quantitative lipase production.The phylogenetic affiliations of the yeast strains were confirmed by investigating the D1/D2 domains of 26S rDNA and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 molecular regions of the six yeast strains selected as potent lipase producers. The three yeast strains A4C, 18B, and 10F showed a close association with Magnusiomyces capitatus. Two yeast strains (17B and AgB) had a close relationship with Saprochaete clavata, whereas the strain AW2 was identified as Magnusiomyces spicifer. Three main catalytic activities of the yeast lipases were evaluated and Magnusiomyces capitatus A4C, among the selected lipase-producing yeasts, had the highest extracellular lipolytic enzyme activity (969 U/L) with the cell-bound lipolytic enzyme activity of 11.3 U/gdm. The maximum cell-bound lipolytic activity (12.4 U/gdm) was observed in the cell-bound lipase fraction produced by Magnusiomyces spicifer AW2 with an extracellular lipolytic enzyme activity of 886 U/L. Based on the specific hydrolytic enzymatic activities, the cell-bound lipases (CBLs) from the three yeast strains M. capitatus A4C, M. spicifer AW2, and Saprochaete clavata 17B were further investigated for biodiesel production. Among them, the CBL from M. spicifer AW2 synthesized the most FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) at 81.2% within 12 h indicating that it has potential for application in enzymatic biodiesel production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Copper molybdate nanoplates were synthesized by a sonochemical process at room temperature, which we report as a simple and cost-effective route. Structural analysis of the material by the Rietveld method of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data revealed lindgrenite Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 in a single-phase structure. All the vibrational modes characteristic of the space group were identified by Raman vibrational and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopies. The profile obtained for N2 adsorption/desorption was type III hysteresis, characteristic of mesoporous materials, with a surface area of 70.77(1) m2 g−1. The micrographs of the material obtained by scanning electron microscopy showed nanoplates with nanometric sizes and an anisotropic growth aspect. The catalytic activity of lindgrenite was evaluated by esterifying oleic acid with methanol, showing high conversion rate to methyl oleate and good catalyst stability after seven recycling cycles. Above all, the best catalytic performance was reached when we optimized parameters such as oleic acid:methanol molar ratio of 1:5, 5% of catalyst dosage, and reaction time of 5 h, resulting in 98.38% of conversion at 413 K. Therefore, sonochemically synthesized lindgrenite proved to be a high potential material for biofuel production by oleic acid esterification. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Climate change could impact nutrient bioavailability in aquatic environment. To understand the interaction of nutrient bioavailability and elevated CO2, Chlorella vulgaris cells were grown in ambient air or 5% CO2 in different concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in a photobioreactor. The chlorophyll content, photosynthesis and respiration rates increased in 5% CO2 to support higher biomass production. The nutrient limitation in the growth media resulted in reduced photosynthetic rates of the algal cells and their PSI, PSII, and whole chain electron transport rates and biomass production. Conversely, their lipid content increased partly due to upregulation of expression of several lipid biosynthesis genes. The order of downregulation of photosynthesis and upregulation in lipid production due to nutrient limitation was in the order of N &gt; P. The N-50 and 5% CO2 culture had only 10% reduction in biomass and 32% increase in lipids having 85% saturated fat required for efficient biofuel production. This growth condition is ideal for generation of biodiesel required to reduce the consumption of fossil fuel and combat global warming. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - A large amount of spent bleaching earth (SBE) solid waste is generated by the vegetable oil refining industry. This spent bleaching earth contains entrapped crude oil and in most cases, it is disposed of in its pristine state, which is considered an environmental hazard. In this work, the regeneration of SBE by pyrolysis or solvent extraction, and the conversion of the recovered entrapped vegetable oil to biodiesel are investigated. The entrapped oil was extracted using n-hexane, methanol or steam as solvents, and the SBE was regenerated by pyrolysis under inert environment of Nitrogen at 450 °C, 550 °C and 650 °C. After oil extraction, the regenerated bleaching earth (RBE) was activated and employed in virgin vegetable oil bleaching. Peroxide activated samples of methanol-extracted and pyrolyzed regenerated bleaching earth at 450 °C and 650 °C exhibit superior bleaching property; demonstrating that the SBE could be regenerated to have superior bleaching capacity over fresh bleaching earth. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of the SBE show that methanol extracted 23.5% out of the 35% residual oil (i.e. 67% efficiency) compared to 15.7% (i.e. 45% efficiency) by n-hexane, while pyrolysis extracted 33% out of the 35% residual oil (i.e. 95% efficiency). GC–MS analysis of the produced biodiesel shows that the n-hexane extracted oil produces more fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Therefore, the choice of solvent depends on the intended application; as methanol regenerates the SBE better while retaining its adsorptive properties, while n-hexane gives a better biodiesel yield. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a GC–MS method was developed for the quantification of saccharides in complex mixtures such as bio-oils and bio-oil aqueous phases produced by ablative pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. The samples were first treated using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and the trimethylsilylated (more volatile) derivatives were analyzed by GC–MS. The method offers advantages of great separation capability and simultaneous identification of unknown peaks by comparison of the mass spectra and retention indices with extensive libraries available online. However, even with these tools at hand, the identification of several saccharide-resembling compounds can be challenging especially in such highly complex samples as pyrolysis bio-oils. For this reason, we devised a novel procedure, which eliminates certain saccharides depending on their specific chemical properties before subjecting the samples to the GC–MS analysis. The procedure was based on the combination of aniline treatment (elimination of reducing aldoses), and hydrolysis (elimination of anhydrosugars, glycosides, disaccharides and oligosaccharides). Based on the differences in chromatograms before and after the procedure, the unknown compounds were assigned into groups based on their susceptibility to each treatment. The combination of all methods above has allowed more accurate identification and quantification of saccharides, some of which were not as of today found in bio-oils. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion is a practical process for recovering energy and materials from sewage sludge. However, land disposal of the derived digestate results in environmental problems, such as eutrophication and salinization. Copyrolysis of sewage sludge digestate and lignocellulosic biomass produces a high-quality oil, a diluted hazardous component of biochar. This study investigates the copyrolysis behavior of lignocellulosic biomass and sludge digestate with different blending ratios using bench-scale experiments. Compared to individual feedstock pyrolysis, copyrolysis shows a higher energy distribution in the liquid product and a lower energy distribution in the char and gas product. The highest energy yield with respect to the organic fraction of liquid product is observed in the copyrolysis case, corresponding to 36.4% of the total energy in the feedstock. The interaction between the sludge digestate and lignocellulosic biomass is studied through product characterizations, mechanistic investigations and char stability assessments. The liquid products in the copyrolysis cases show a relatively high abundance of esters, aliphatic hydrocarbons, pyridines and pyrroles. The reaction pathways of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates are investigated. Two synergistic reaction pathways are proposed. The char stability and nitrogen distribution are investigated. According to the results, the synergistic interaction between feedstocks enhances the quality and energy yield of the liquid biofuel. The char product from copyrolysis has higher potential for use as a carbon sink and fertilizer. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The physicochemical properties of dried distiller's grains (DDGs) were measured and the pyrolysis kinetics analysis was experimentally investigated by the non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at four heating rates of 10, 20, 30 and 40 K min−1. The results of proximate and elemental analysis showed that DDGs contained relatively high contents of volatile organic components (VOCs, 89.4 wt.%) and carbon (47.0 wt.%), and a higher value of heat content (20.4 MJ kg−1), compared with some other typical agricultural residues feedstocks. The pyrolysis kinetics of DDGs sample were analyzed using the Friedman isoconversional method. The obtained effective activation energies vary with the degree of conversion: 151.2-176.3 kJ mol−1 (α: 0.05−0.10, T: 383–506 K), 176.3-206.4 kJ mol−1 (α: 0.10−0.60, T: 506–653 K), 206.4-320.5 kJ mol−1 (α: 0.60−0.95, T: &gt; 653 K), which correspond to the thermal decomposition of hemicellulose, cellulose and part of lignin, and remaining lignin. And the decomposition temperatures of DDGs components shift to lower temperature, compared with those of typical lignocellulosic biomass, which is caused by the presence of high activity degraded enzymes during brewing process. The physicochemical properties and pyrolysis kinetic results have shown that DDGs has great thermochemical conversion potential for bioenergy. We anticipate these findings will contribute to the industrial application of DDGs pyrolysis to produce biofuel or high-value chemicals and materials. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An enzymatic biofuel cell cathode was elaborated by nano-structuration and functionalization of graphite using two consecutive plasma treatments before immobilization of laccase as a biocatalyst to perform oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by direct electron transfer ((DET). Nano-structuration of graphite surfaces by synthesis of vertical graphen-like carbon nanowalls (CNWs) was performed by microwave excited plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) system was then used to functionalize chemically the CNWs surface via a rapid and dry route. A partial fractional design evidenced two significant parameters of the APPJ treatment in terms of ORR current density: the treatment time and the inter-distance between the plasma jet and the surface of the carbon material. With the optimized APPJ treatment parameters, a four-fold enhancement of the ORR current density (-440 ± 70 µA/cm2) could be obtained on CNWs, compared to graphite electrodes. The best current density obtained was about −1 mA/cm2 with oxidized laccase covalently immobilized on the electrode without any agitation of the solution, confirming the main importance of enzyme orientation on the electrode surface for efficient DET transfer, the relevance of electrode nanostructuration and the advantage of covalent linking of the protein on the electrode surface. © 2021

AB  - The presence of metallic species in biofuels has increased considerably during the last few years. The deposition of these species in non-metallic components of automotive engines can cause their degradation due to oxidative or catalytic processes, thus decreasing their useful life. Therefore, the problem imposes the need to implement methodologies with selectivity, sensitivity and adequate reproducibility in the detection of these inorganic species. This is the first study to determine the species Fe3+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+ using boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes in an ethanolic medium with anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). Thus, the ASV methodological parameters for accumulation time (Tacc), accumulation potential (Eacc), frequency (f) and amplitude (a) were optimized in different electrolyte media using BDD electrodes with a doping level of 8000 ppm in the determination of these metallic species. The limits of detection (LoD) and quantification (LoQ) were obtained from the analytical curves, reaching values (LoD) below 2 µg.L−1 for all species. After the optimization of the ASV parameters, tests were performed on samples collected from different gas stations in the municipality of Manaus, Brazil. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Designing an artificial enzyme, from the perspective of bionics, to mimic the catalytic activity of natural enzymes is highly desirable but remains challenges. In response to the simulation of biological structure, we developed cytochrome c oxidase (CcO)-like single-atom nanozymes with FeN5 active centers (FeN5 SAs) in this work. Similar to the spatial structure of heme a3 in natural CcO, the active center of FeN5 SAs is axial N-coordinated heme-like structure and can be served as oxygen-binding site to complete oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in respiratory electron transport chain by catalyzing the oxidation of cytochrome c (Cyt c). Depending on this bionic structure, furthermore, FeN5 SAs exhibited competitive electrocatalytic performance towards ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.67 V (vs. RHE) at neutral condition. Coupling a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) bioanode, the FeN5 SAs-based glucose/O2 enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) obtained a maximum power density of 149.2 ± 4.0 μW cm−2 with an open circuit potential of 0.40 ± 0.01 V. In this study, inspired by the native structure of enzymes, we develop CcO-like FeN5 SAs and expand its application in EBFCs, which may provide an rational research approach to advance the development of nanozymes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work assessed the impact of biodiesel impurities on CeO2 catalyst for soot combustion via soot-TPO experiments. The results showed that Na- and K-doped catalysts were assisted for soot combustion, while Ca- and P-doped catalysts had a negative effect. N2 adsorption-desorption and XRD results indicated that doping biodiesel impurities led to smaller surface area by blocking small pores. Surface chemical properties are suggested as major reasons for promoting soot combustion by means of XPS, H2-TPR, and O2-TPD. Na- and K-doped catalysts showed stronger redox ability and surface lattice oxygen mobility, poorly for Ca- and P-doped catalysts. Interestingly, a large number of surface oxygen species were observed on P-doped catalyst and it enhanced the ignition of bio soot. In the presence of NO, surface chemical properties including NOx storage/release capacity and NO oxidation ability were characterized by NO-adsorption DRIFTS, NO-TPO and NOx-desorption DRIFTS, alkali-doped catalyst with excellent NOx storage capacity that can release active oxygen species and gaseous NO2 accelerate heterogeneous soot combustion, and the poor NO conversion ability to NO2 that weakens the promotion effect of soot combustion. Particularly in the existence of P, the promotion effect of soot elimination in NO + O2 was further weakened by the reason of poor NOx storage capacity and NO oxidation ability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The effects of neutralization, transesterification, and adsorption on the physicochemical properties of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) obtained from crude catfish oil (CO) were investigated. CO was recovered from catfish viscera and subjected to: neutralization (NCO) with 20 (g/100 g) NaOH solution, transesterification (BIO) with methyl alcohol (1:6 molar ratio, oil: alcohol) and 1 (g/100 g) (w/w) NaOH, and purification by adsorption (PBIO) with activated earth (10 g/100 g of BIO). CO, NCO, BIO, and PBIO were evaluated for FAME, free fatty acids (FFA), peroxide value (PV), cloud and flash points, free and total glycerin, rheological properties, and minerals. Catfish viscera had a lipid content of 28.5 g/100 g (wet basis), of which 20.9 g were recovered as CO (73.33% yield). Furthermore, 84.67 g of NCO, 77.53 g of BIO, and/or 60.22 g of PBIO were produced from 100 g of CO processed. NCO had significantly (P < 0.05) lower FFA, density, cloud point, flash point, and diacylglycerols content than CO. Meanwhile, PBIO had significantly (P < 0.05) lower PV and cloud points when compared to BIO. CO, NCO, BIO, and PBIO behaved as Newtonian fluids at 25 °C. BIO and PBIO adhere to the american society for testing and materials (ASTM) biodiesel standards for FAME, moisture, density, cloud point, free and total glycerin, Na, P, and S. This study demonstrated the feasibility of converting high-viscosity CO into low-viscosity PBIO with promising physicochemical attributes. PBIO has the potential to serve as a viable alternative biofuel. © 2021 AOCS

AB  - Abstract: Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is an innovative technology, which can yield valuable organic chemicals with concomitant CO2 sequestration by employing microbes as biocatalysts. The mode of operation has an imperative role in the performance of MES, thus, affecting the yield of synthesized organic chemicals from the MES. However, to the best of our knowledge, the optimal mode of operation for MES has not been determined till date. Hence, in the present investigation, two MES were operated: one in batch mode (MES-B) and another in continuous mode (MES-C), and their performance was monitored. The MES-B exhibited 31%, 33.5% and 44% higher production rate of acetate, propionate and butyrate, respectively, in comparison to MES-C. Moreover, the performance of MES-B also stabilized faster, and microbiome in the cathodic chamber of MES-B was able to accept 26% more electrons supplied to it externally, which were employed as reducing equivalents to reduce CO2. The enactment of MES-B was superior to that of MES-C due to the higher retention of CO2 and hydrogen in cathodic chamber of MES-B. Therefore, operating MES in batch mode would aid in yielding more organic chemicals through CO2 sequestration.

AB  - The subject of this study was to upgrade the pyrolysis bio-oil by torrefaction combined with different order of acid washing. The pyrolysis behavior of biochar obtained from different pretreatments were investigated by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) and fixed furnace. Moreover, the composition of bio-oil was systematically analyzed by GC-MS. The results showed that torrefaction promoted the aggregation of phenols in bio-oil through removing the hemicellulose and part of cellulose. In addition, aldehydes had increased significantly after acid washing. The acid washing combined with torrefaction could reduce the formation of acids, alcohols and other organic substances except for phenols, aldehydes and ketones. Compared with the pyrolysis bio-oil obtained by directly torrefaction pretreatment, the absolute content of phenols in the pyrolysis bio-oil was slightly reduced from 74 mg/gRH to 63 mg/gRH after first inorganic acid washing and then torrefaction, while the absolute content of furfural increased from 2.8 mg/gRH to 16 mg/gRH. The mechanism showed that the furfural was selected by the catalysis of acid and the torrefaction promoted the cellulose to convert to 1-hydroxy-2-propanone by cracking reaction. This study provided a simple and practical method for the selective production of furfural and phenol from rice husk. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: Production of biobased chemicals from renewable resources is a green starring approach that serves as a substitute to petroleum derivatives. Bioglycerol, with its growing production as a co-product of biodiesel, is an attractive low-cost feedstock for the synthesis of platform chemicals by microbial fermentation. 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) is amongst the top biorefinery platform chemicals that can be produced by glycerol fermentation. RESULTS: The ‘Circular Economy’ concept is demonstrated by converting the by-product bioglycerol using a cell-free extract of Enterobacter aerogenes NCIM 2695 (National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms, NCIM), yielding 22 g L−1 2,3-BDO, in 96 h, 98% atom economy and 0.4 g/g E factor. The cell-free bioglycerol conversion to 2,3-BDO was proved using a modified procedure for determining glycerol dehydrogenase enzyme assay by protein analysis and it was also shown to be cell-bounded. CONCLUSION: Our study offers an effective utilization of the leftover material (i.e. cell-free extract) that biocatalysed C3 to C4 diol, which adds value to the overall economics of the process using only crude glycerol (C3) itself as a fermentative medium. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) of walnut shells (WS) results in only a limited biomethane yield because of their high fibre content, which ultimately represents an essentially nonbiodegradable lignocellulosic biomass. In the present study, thermal (i.e. 50–250 °C), alkaline (i.e. 1–5% w/w NaOH) and combined alkaline-thermal (i.e. 4% w/w NaOH + 150 °C thermal) pretreatment methods have been applied to increase the anaerobic biodegradation of WS. The highest biomethane yields of 159.9 ± 6.8 mL CH4.g VS–1 and 169.8 ± 6.8 mL CH4.g VS-1 were achieved after pretreatment at both 250 °C and with 4% NaOH. After combined NaOH-thermal pretreatments, the AD process showed the largest total VFA concentration (i.e. 1280.1 mg Hac L–1) but a relatively high lag phase (i.e. 3.90 days) compared to thermal and NaOH pretreatments alone, from which the highest biomethane yield (i.e. 192.4 ± 8.2 mL CH4.g VS-1) was achieved at the end of the AD process. The highest biomethane yield from the combined NaOH-thermal pretreated WS was corroborated by the corresponding highest SCOD/TCOD ratio (i.e. 0.37 ± 0.02) and the highest lignocellulosic fibre removal (i.e. 41.1 ± 2.7% cellulose, 35.6 ± 1.8% hemicellulose, and 58.7 ± 3.2% lignin). The cumulative biomethane yields were further simulated via a modified Gompertz model. This study provides a promising strategy in the sense that the biomethane yield of WS containing large amounts of lignin can be significantly increased via thermal, NaOH, and combined NaOH-thermal pretreatment methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The kinetics of the transesterification reaction has been explored theoretically. A general rate equation (GRE) was obtained for kinetics modeling of transesterification at the entire time of reaction based on a three-step mechanism. It has been shown that the GRE model converts to a Second-Order (SO) model at short initial times of reaction and it converts to Pseudo-First-Order (PFO) model at short initial times of reaction and high concentration of alcohol. Also, a modified form of the Second-Order model (MSO) was derived when the reaction is spontaneous (at ΔrG≪0 conditions or at short initial times of reaction). The accuracy of theoretical models and our assumptions was evaluated by three sets of experimental data selected at literature. It has been shown that the accuracy of PFO, SO, and MSO models followed the order of MSO &gt; SO &gt; PFO at short initial times while the GRE model is a suitable kinetics model at the entire times of reaction. Also, our research, contrary to what has been reported so far in published papers, shows that pseudo-first-order and second-order models are only accurate for kinetics modeling of the transesterification reaction at short initial times of reaction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The continuous production of a diesel-like biofuel from palm oil was evaluated by coupling two reactions stages in series, pre-hydrogenation with a Ni/Al2O3 catalyst at 250 °C and LHSV of 2 h−1, followed by deoxygenation with a sulfided Ni–Mo/Al2O3 at 350–380 °C and LHSV of 1.6–3.3 h-1. The purpose of this process configuration was to improve the selectivity because side reactions on the double bonds, such as polymerization, ring formation and aromatization could be avoided. Both reactions were studied at 3 MPa. In the Ni catalyst, all the metal was in its reduced state and in three different types of cluster. The sulfided Ni–Mo catalyst had mainly sulfided MoSx and Ni-MoSx, but also appreciable amounts of reduced metal species, and the sulfided species were stable up to 500 °C. The pre-hydrogenation enabled the use of higher LHSV without losing conversion nor yield and this means that for a fix throughput, less deoxygenation catalyst can be used. The yield was decreased, at all experimental conditions evaluated, when pre-hydrogenation was not done, due to side reactions on the double bonds. The decarboxylation route was predominant (69.3%) followed by the decarbonylation (11.5%) and the hydrodeoxygenation routes (19.2%). The product had properties similar or superior to those of fossil diesel and biodiesel, with the exception of cold flow properties that were worse than those of fossil diesel but very similar to those of biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Consumers are becoming more aware of their role in the propagation of environmental issues, the transition from passive consumer to prosumer is emerging, and it is of interest to know the commitment factors that leads the biodiesel prosumer to act in favor of an organization which they belong in order to achieve one goal in common and contribute to local sustainable development. In this research, the prosumer is the one who participates as a member and consumer of a biodiesel cooperative. The prosumer's commitment is made up of two components: (i) nonactive or affective, identification with the organization, and (ii) active or participatory, action towards certain goals. The objectives of the investigation are to evaluate the biodiesel prosumer's commitment and know its causes and effects. The hypotheses on the causes and results of the prosumer's commitment are postulated in a structural equation model (SEM), whose theoretical basis corresponds to the double role of the prosumer: member and client of the cooperative. The SEM is evaluated from the perspective of the prosumer based on mixed methodology and partial least square (PLS). The proposed SEM explains 78% (R2 = 0.78) of the variability of the contribution of the biodiesel cooperative to local sustainable development, where this contribution is directly and significantly impacted by the two components of the commitment. This case study identifies dimensions that lead the biodiesel prosumer to commit in the cocreation and consumption of renewable fuel, which gives more opportunities for long-term survival of this initiative in a competitive market. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Carbonaceous materials are promising electrode materials for enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) due to their excellent electrical conductivity, chemical and physical stability and biocompatibility. Design and preparation of carbon materials with a hollow structure and a rough surface are of great significance for immobilization of enzymes both inside and outside the carbon materials for EBFC applications. We report herein the synthesis of novel carbonaceous materials consisting of bamboo-shaped hollow N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) and C3N4 nanosheets (denoted as N-CNTs@C3N4) as electrode materials for dual-capture of enzymes in glucose/O2 EBFCs. The combination of one-dimensional N-CNTs with an open structure and two-dimensional C3N4 nanosheets forms a three-dimensional crosslinking network that significantly enhances the immobilization of enzymes, electrode stability, and mass transfer of substrates, thus boosting the EBFC performance. As a result, EBFCs equipped with N-CNTs@C3N4 can generate a high open circuit potential of 0.93 V and output a maximum power density of 0.57 mW cm-2 at 0.47 V. Additionally, the as-fabricated glucose/O2 EBFCs are capable of directly harvesting energy from various soft drinks, which indicates the promising applications of the N-CNTs@C3N4 nanocomposite as an electrode material for EBFCs. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Currently, developing high-performance non-noble metal catalysts for the conversion of biomass-derived compounds to valuable chemicals or biofuels remains a great challenge. Herein, surface CoFeOx-decorated bimetallic CoFe catalysts were developed via a Co-Mg-Fe layered double hydroxide precursor strategy and utilized for the transfer hydrogenolysis of 5-hydromethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) with the help of formic acid as the sustainable hydrogen donor. The as-fabricated CoFe bimetallic catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance with a high yield of DMF (>92%). Contrarily, monometallic Co-based catalyst delivered a much lower DMF yield. The structural characterizations and catalytic experiments demonstrated that the catalytic behavior of bimetallic CoFe catalysts was correlated with the appropriate combination of highly dispersed bimetallic metallic nanoparticles and abundant oxygen vacancies originating from surface CoFeOx species, as well as favorable surface basic sites, thereby facilitating the dehydrogenation of formic acid and improving the affinity for carbonyl reduction, which promoted the selective hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of carbonyl or hydroxymethyl group in HMF and reaction intermediates. Furthermore, excellent structural advantages of as-fabricated CoFe catalyst, such as high alloying degree of CoFe and strong metal-support interactions, endowed it with good stability and regeneration performance. The present bimetal-defect interfacial engineering strategy may provide a potential guide for the rational design of high-performance non-noble-metal catalysts for a variety of heterogeneous catalysis processes in terms of the conversion of biomass source. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Exploiting suitable oxidation catalysts is of great importance in the development of sugar-based fuel cells (SFCs). Herein, a novel room-temperature glucose/O2fuel cell (GFC), which employs 4-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (ACT) as an anodic electrocatalyst and air-breathing Pt-C as a cathode, is demonstrated. Under room temperature operation, the as-assembled GFCs are capable of delivering a maximum power density of 100 μW cm−2in the presence of 50 mM glucose. Bulk electrolysis products of glucose identified by mass spectrum and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy include gluconic acid and glucaric acid, suggesting that the aldehyde and primary hydroxy groups of glucose can be deeply oxidized into carboxyl groups through a 6e−pathway. The deep glucose oxidation capability makes ACT a promising anodic electrocatalyst for SFCs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Salicornia bigelovii(SB) is a strategically important plant in many regions owing to its ability to grow in arid climates and saline water. This study evaluates the effects of halophyte biomass pre-treatment on the production of bio-oil and biocharviapyrolysis of SB. The pyrolysis experiments were performed in a quartz tube reactor at 600, 700, and 800 °C to understand the effect of the temperature on the products obtained from untreated SB (USB) and pre-treated SB (PSB). USB and PSB samples were characterized to determine their thermal stability, elemental composition, mineral composition, and functional group identification. Pre-treatment of SB reduced the ash and Na content by 71% and 45%, respectively. Ash removal favored the pyrolysis-assisted extraction of carboxylic acids, and their selectivity in the bio-oil increased from 20.7% (USB) to 33.4% (PSB) at 600 °C. The selectivity to phenolics was observed to be the highest at 800 °C in the bio-oil from USB (10.4%) and PSB (13.4%). PSB pyrolysis increased the specific surface area of biochar by four times, whereas carbon nanostructures were observed in the biochar from USB. The formation pathways of the major compounds from the pyrolysis of various amino acids, cellulose, hemicellulose, fatty acids, and lignin present in SB were elucidated by proposing a plausible reaction scheme. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Electrocatalytic synthesis of valuable biofuels and chemicals from biomass-derived acids is a promising approach, but selectively producing deoxygenated hydrocarbons is still a great challenge. In this work, we investigated selective electrochemical decarboxylation of n-octanoic acid to produce hydrocarbons (n-tetradecane, n-heptane, and n-heptene) in a single electrolytic cell at room temperature. Pt nanoparticles with different morphologies (nanospheres, nanoflowers, and nanothorns) and further Pt nanothorns with different plane distributions on carbon fiber paper (CFP) were fabricated by a controllable electrodeposition method. The results proved that the Pt(311) plane has the best selectivity and intrinsic activity for decarboxylation products, especially for Kolbe hydrocarbons. The Pt(110) plane shows a similar intrinsic activity as the Pt(311) planes. High selectivity (75%), yield (35%), and Faraday efficiency (34%) for hydrocarbons were achieved over the Pt nanothorn (Pt-NT), which were approximately 1.6, 2.3, and 3.3 times that of Pt nanoflowers, Pt nanospheres, and Pt/C, respectively. The high electrocatalytic activity of Pt nanothorns was attributed to its high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and enhanced intrinsic activity derived from the high level of Pt(311) and Pt(110) planes. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Cellulase-mimetic solid acid catalysts (CMSAC), having both cellulose-binding and catalytic sites, are known to have much lower activation energy and higher catalytic activity than traditional solid acid catalysts. It is an emerging greener and cost-friendly solution for producing biofuel, such as bio-hydrogen, from lignocellulose. However, in 2018 the widely used CMSAC, sulfonated chloromethyl polystyrene, was found to have its catalytic activity attributed to the in-situ release of HCl during catalytic hydrolysis, which is unexpected. An ab initio quantum calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) is performed to study its reaction mechanism. Results have shown that the most probable mechanism responsible for the in-situ release of HCl is through SN1 nucleophilic substitution. The simulation also predicted a surface reaction activation energy of 1.56 eV (35.97 kcal/mol), along the predicted minimum energy path (MEP). This is the first ab initio study to theoretically predict the HCl leaching mechanism from CMSAC before its industrial application. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - NiO-supported TiO2 (nNiO/TiO2) as highly active and selective catalysts for triacetyl glyceride (TAG) biofuel additive production via acetylation of glycerol is reported. The catalysts are prepared by incorporating various amounts of Ni2+ (n = 10, 30 and 50 wt% Ni added during catalysts preparation) onto the TiO2 support using simple sol-gel approach followed by calcination. The spectroscopy and microscopy analyses reveal that the NiO nanoparticles (ca. 6 nm) are uniformly distributed on the surface of TiO2 support where octahedrally coordinated NiO as active species is formed upon calcination. Among the catalysts prepared, 30NiO/TiO2 with strongest acidity and highest accessible surface area is found to be the most active in the acetylation of glycerol with acetic acid, achieving 90.2% glycerol conversion with 65.9% selective to TAG under non-microwave instant heating conditions (170 °C, 30 min). In addition, 30NiO/TiO2 also shows better catalytic performance than previous reported catalysts. No significant deterioration in catalytic activity is shown by 30NiO/TiO2 after eight successive runs, thus offering a green pathway for synthesizing TAG vehicle fuel additives with high selectivity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The development of bioenergy in marginal environments has been hampered by the lack of sustainable sources of biomass. The halophyte Salicornia bigelovii, has been found to adapt extremely well in a desert climate. In this study, the S. bigelovii seed and the seedless-plant have been assessed, for the first time, for biofuel and biochar production through thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis) in an auger reactor operated at 550 °C. Both feedstocks showed significant differences in chemical composition, with the seed being closer to the characteristics of seeds from common oilseed crops. The S. bigelovii seed produced high bio-oil yield (79.9% of total liquid) of high pH predominated with fatty acids commonly found in vegetable oils. The S. bigelovii seedless-plant produced a liquid of significantly low bio-oil (10% of total liquid) with an aqueous phase of pH and salinity close that of brackish water. The biochars were of moderate heating value and limited potentials for soil amendment due to the high ash content in the biomass, but are reasonably stable for long term carbon sequestration due to their low O/C and H/C ratios (<0.1 and <1.0, respectively). Comparative assessment in terms of the conversion efficiency and renewability indicated that pyrolysis of the S. bigelovii seed offers a good opportunity for biofuel production in arid/semi-arid saline regions against the alternative option of transesterification conversion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, highly defected and functionalized metal-organic framework (MOF) structures are developed and exploited as catalysts for an esterification reaction for biofuel production. Two systems of multivariate UiO-66 series, namely MTV-UiO-66(COOH)2 and MTV-UiO-66(OH)2 incorporating dicarboxylate and dihydroxy groups, respectively, along with the single component structures, are thus explored for butyl butyrate production. Ratios of functionalized linkers to terephthalic acid are varied and a modulation synthesis approach is employed allowing for high levels of structural defects. The synthesized MOF structures are fully characterized using Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the results confirmed the homogeneous incorporation of the functionalized linkers in the structures. The combination of multivariate approach along with modulation synthesis yields structures with catalytic activity higher than those of highly defective fully functionalized structures and close to the homogeneous conventional catalyst used in esterification reactions. Moreover, the ratio of functionalized linkers to terephthalic acid is shown to be very important since not all MTV-UiO-66 performed better than the single-component structure which can be attributed to a combination of factors related to the density of active sites and their accessibility. The most active MTV-UiO-66(OH)2 member, incorporating 52% of functionalized linkers, a defects number of 1.9, and a surface area of 761 m2/g, yielded 92% conversion to butyl butyrate, compared to 95% for H2SO4, and its activity and stability is maintained over 4 consecutive cycles. Furthermore, by using the data of 33 different UiO-66 based catalysts for butyl butyrate production, a weighted linear regression model is suggested to predict the conversion based on the parameters that are concluded to mostly govern the catalytic activity of MOF catalysts. These parameters include the surface area, the catalytic loading, the defects number, and the level of incorporation of BDC, and the functionalized linkers. The weights calculated for each of these parameters indicate that there is a more pronounced effect of active sites density on the conversion when compared to the surface area or the catalyst loading. These conclusions help pave the way for the engineering of MOF-based catalysts in the path of bridging the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis for efficient biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainable and cleaner production of liquid biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) is in great demand. Because of its water insolubility, high boiling point, and high energy density, DMF seems to be a promising liquid biofuel. Selective hydrogenation of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-DMF can be achieved using novel catalysts and is presented here. In this study, a series of Al-Zr mixed oxide catalysts (AZMO) were prepared by co-precipitation and hydrothermal techniques. AZMO catalyst prepared by the co-precipitation method gave higher acidity and surface area. Furthermore, mono and bimetallic M/AZMOCP (M = Ni, Co, Cu, and Pd) catalysts were developed by the impregnation and used for hydrogenation of HMF. The catalytic activity was found in the order of: 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 1%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 2%Pd-3%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 1%Pd-3%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 5%Ni-5%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 1%Pd/AZMOCP &gt; 5%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 5%Cu-5%Co/AZMOCP &gt; 3%Co/AZMOCP. It was found that 2%Pd-5%Co/AZMOCP resulted in complete conversion of HMF with 97% yield of DMF at 100 °C and 10 atm H2 pressure. The catalysts were characterized by sophisticated techniques such as FESEM, EDS, XRD, NH3-TPD, ATR-FTIR, BET analysis, HRTEM, TPR, XPS and TGA-DSC. The reaction mechanism was developed based on dual-site Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) model. The catalyst was highly selective and reusable. The overall process is clean and green. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Photosynthetic biomanufacturing is a promising route for green production of biofuels and biochemicals utilizing carbon dioxide and solar energy. Cyanobacteria are important microbial platforms for constructing photosynthetic cell factories. Toward scaled outdoor cultivations in the future, high light and high temperature tolerances of cyanobacterial chassis strains and cell factories would be determinant properties to be optimized. We proposed a convenient strategy for rapidly improving high light and high temperature tolerances of an important cyanobacterial chassis Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and the derived cell factories. Through introduction and isolation of an AtpA-C252F mutation, PCC 7942 mutants with improved high light and high temperature tolerances could be obtained in only 4 days with an antibiotics-free mode. Adopting this strategy, cellular robustness and sucrose synthesizing capacities of a PCC 7942 cell factory were successfully improved. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Zheng, Sun, Zeng, Duan, Luan and Lu.

AB  - Non-edible bio-oil derived from lignocellulosic biomass could be used as environmentally friendly lubricant-ester base stock for maritime and road-type transportations. However, the use of crude bio-oil with highly oxygenated compounds required further upgrading to yield ester that mimicked the characteristics of Group V base oil (polyolesters). In this study, bio-oil based polyolesters was produced via esterification using green biopolymer alginate acid catalyst (Al-Alg). The bio-oil compounds used were acetic acid (AcA), propionic acid (PrA) and levulinic acid (LA), while polyols such as neopentyl glycol (NPG), trimethylolpropane (TMP) and pentaerythritol (PE) were used. Optimization studies revealed that NPG-PrA ester gave the best ester purity of 100%, with 95% of diester selectivity under optimum conditions of 15 wt% Al-Alg, 8 h, 6:1 PrA:NPG and 140 °C. The produced polyolesters showed potential lube characteristics with viscosity index of 76, kinematic viscosity of 2.3 mm2 s−1 at 40 °C and oxidative induction time of 15 min at 100 °C. Furthermore, a reusability study of the Al-Alg catalyst indicated high NPG-PrA diester selectivity (above 90%) for 8 consecutive cycles. The physico-chemical properties of spent Al-Alg catalyst were also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuel produced from biomass pyrolysis is a good example of a highly complex mixture. Detailed understanding of its composition is a prerequisite for optimizing transformation processes and further upgrading conditions. The major challenge in understanding the composition of biofuel derived from biomass is the wide range of compounds with high diversity in polarity and abundance that can be present. In this work, a comprehensive analysis using mass spectrometry is reported. Different operation conditions are studied by utilizing multiple ionization methods (positive mode atmospheric pressure photo ionization (APPI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) and negative mode ESI) and applying different resolving power set-ups (120 k, 240 k, 480 k and 960 k) and scan techniques (full scan and spectral stitching method) to study the complexity of a pyrolysis biofuel. Using a mass resolution of 960 k and the spectral stitching scan technique gives a total of 21,703 assigned compositions for one ionization technique alone. The number of total compositions is significantly expanded by the combination of different ionization methods. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The fact that 60% of the Indian population is dependent on Agricultural practices for their livelihood means that there is a huge potential for the development of second-generation Biofuel. The current work involves the use of Azadirchta excelsa seeds to obtain biofuel. It is a commercial crop grown in Southern parts of India such as Karnataka. It is mainly grown to get timber for building houses and for manufacturing of match sticks. Soxhlet extraction method was used to extract oil from the seeds, with hexane being the choice of solvent and a yield of 35% was obtained. The oil was transesterified using Base (NaOH) catalyst method to produce oil methyl ester. The conversion rate of oil was found to be 50%. The physicochemical parameters of the biodiesel produced were analyzed of other basic parameters. The results lied within the range of American society of testing material (ASTM D6751) standards and Indian Standards (IS) 15607 specifications for biodiesel samples, which conclude that A.excelsa seed oil can be satisfactorily used as a feed-stock for biodiesel production. © 2021

AB  - Small-scale plants that produce biodiesel have many social, economic and environmental advantages. Indeed, small plants significantly contribute to renewable energy production and rural development. Communities can use/reuse local raw materials and manage independently processes to obtain biofuels by essential, simple, flexible and cheap tools for self-supply. The review and understanding of recent plants of small biodiesel production is essential to identify limitations and critical units for improvement of the current process. Biodiesel production consists of four main stages, that are pre-treatment of oils, reaction, separation of products and biodiesel purification. Among lots of possibilities, waste cooking oils were chosen as cheap and green sources to produce biodiesel by base-catalyzed transesterification in a batch reactor. In this paper an overview on small-scale production plants is presented with the aim to put in evidence process, materials, control systems, energy consumption and economic parameters useful for the project and design of such scale of plants. Final considerations related to the use of biodiesel such as renewable energy storage (RES) in small communities are discussed too. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This study reports the application of metallo-stannosilicates as potential inorganic solid matrixes for enzymes immobilization and their use as a heterogenous catalysts in enzymatic transesterification reactions for the conversion of triacylglycerides into fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). Several stannosilicates were synthesized and physicochemical characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)-N2 surface area analysis and solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR 29Si and 119Sn nuclei) techniques. The experimental results for enzymes immobilization were promising, especially for a nickel ion-exchanged metallo-stannosilicate, which were able to immobilize 82 ± 6% of Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase and also kept a high enzymatic activity (42 ± 3 U mg–1). Systematic catalytic reactions for conversion of refined palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) using some of these stannosilicates enzymes complexes yielded 63.3 ± 0.7% of FAEEs. It is worth noticing that, when the transesterification reaction was performed with (a) the as-made stannosilicate without enzymes and (b) the equivalent amount of immobilized Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase in its free form, the FAEEs yield sharply decreased to &lt; 5.0% and 6.3 ± 0.3%, respectively. This result is a clear evidence of a synergistic effect among the metallo-stannosilicates and the immobilized enzymes. © 2021 Atlantis Livros Ltda.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microbial lipids hold great promise as biofuel precursors, and research efforts to convert such lipids to renewable diesel fuels have been increasing in recent years. In contrast to the numerous literature reviews on growing, characterising and extracting lipids from oleaginous microbes, and on converting vegetable oils to hydrocarbon fuels, this review aims to provide insight into aspects that are specific to hydroprocessing microbial lipids. While standard hydrotreating catalysts generally perform well with terrestrial oils, differences in lipid speciation and the presence of co-extracted compounds, such as chlorophyll and sterols, introduce additional complexities into the process for microbial lipids. Lipid cleanup steps can be introduced to produce suitable feedstocks for catalytic upgrading. © 2021 Johnson Matthey.

AB  - In order to study the performance of a biomass-fed gasifier, a gasification model was established based on chemical equilibrium. In this model, sewage sludge with different water content was used as feedstock. Air was introduced into the gasifier as a gasifying agent. The objectives of the model were (a) calculating the equilibrium temperatures in the gasifier; (b) calculating syngas compositions and heating values at corresponding equilibrium temperatures; (c) finding out the effect of moisture content in the sludge and equivalence ratio on the gasification process; and (d) using a mixed feed-stock instead of single feedstock to improve syngas yield. The model was built in MATLAB and Cantera. Elements balance, chemical equilibrium, and enthalpy balance were used in the model. For 1 kg sludge, the moisture contents of sludge range from 0.1 to 0.8, and the equivalence ratios range from 0.5 to 4. The results show that (a) when moisture content = 0.1, ER = 2.47, the CO yield reaches maximum value of 17.548 mol/(kg sludge); (b) when moisture content = 0.1, ER = 2.83, the H2 yield reaches maximum value of 20.756 mol/(kg sludge). Gasification performance can be improved by mixing sludge with lignite. For 1 kg mixture, the results show that (a) the maximum yield of CO increases from 3.04 to 12.3 mol/(kg mixture) with the increase of lignite content from 10% to 40%; (b) the maximum yield of H2 increases from 13.75 to 21.88 mol/(kg mixture) with the increase of lignite content from 10% to 40%. © 2021 Desalination Publications.

AB  - Abstract: Several thousand different terpenoid structures are known so far, and many of them are interesting for applications as pharmaceuticals, flavors, fragrances, biofuels, insecticides, or fine chemical intermediates. One prominent example is camphor, which has been utilized since ancient times in medical applications. Especially (−)-camphor is gaining more and more interest for pharmaceutical applications. Hence, a commercial reliable source is needed. The natural sources for (−)-camphor are limited, and the oxidation of precious (−)-borneol would be too costly. Hence, synthesis of (−)-camphor from renewable alpha-pinene would be an inexpensive alternative. As the currently used route for the conversion of alpha-pinene to camphor produces a mixture of both enantiomers, preferably catalytic methods for the separation of this racemate are demanded to yield enantiopure camphor. Enzymatic kinetic resolution is a sustainable way to solve this challenge but requires suitable enzymes. In this study, the first borneol dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas sp. ATCC 17453, capable of catalyzing the stereoselective reduction of camphor, was examined. By using a targeted enzyme engineering approach, enantioselective enzyme variants were created with E-values > 100. The best variant was used for the enzymatic kinetic resolution of camphor racemate, yielding 79% of (−)-camphor with an ee of > 99%. Key points: • Characterization of a novel borneol dehydrogenase (BDH) from P. putida. • Development of enantioselective BDH variants for the reduction of camphor. • Enzymatic kinetic resolution of camphor with borneol dehydrogenase.

AB  - This paper explores several renewable energy sources to help Malaysia reduce its carbon footprint. Accordingly, this study employs a partial equilibrium model to examine the potential of the Malaysian agricultural sector to supply biodiesel, bioethanol, and bioelectricity on a commercial scale to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG). The model includes the fourteen agricultural commodities of Malaysia. The results show that bioethanol is economically feasible with its fossil fuel counterpart, while bioelectricity is almost economically feasible. Both bioethanol and bioelectricity have the potential to offset significant GHG emissions of fossil fuels. Furthermore, this study finds that biodiesel has little mitigation on GHG emissions and cannot compete with diesel. Biodiesel also would expand the agricultural industry, which could raise agricultural prices and hasten deforestation. Therefore, the Malaysian government should further study bioethanol and bioelectricity as two candidates to supply renewable energy and help the nation meets its GHG commitment under the Paris Agreement. This study highlights further research for cellulosic ethanol because it is still in the experimental stage. © 2021

AB  - The implications of climate change on a global scale have resulted in the shift towards resource circular platforms which encourages waste valorization and lowers environmental impact. Within the transport sector, biofuels-namely biodiesel, has emerged as a successful candidate promoting greater sustainable development. However, due to its growth and popularity, crude glycerol- a by-product of the biodiesel process, has remained as an underrated waste stream which threatens the inherent sustainability of the biodiesel process. Here, we showcase multiple decision criteria facilitated by techno-economic and environmental assessments, to support a resource circular biodiesel process through glycerol upcycling- utilizing anaerobic digestion (AD) for energy integration and glycerol reforming for circular methanol production. Our findings illustrate increased energy efficiency through AD, with reductions in electricity and fuel consumption across the biodiesel process promoting reduced annualized costs compared to capital- intensive circular methanol production. Insights into life cycle assessments and the use of planetary boundaries, reveal circular methanol production as the desired pathway for reduced GHG emissions associated with carbon capture and utilization. However, the subsequent increase in energy consumption necessary for thermochemical conversion inadvertently causes burden-shifting to other impact categories- consolidating higher environmental impacts specifically for human health and resource depletion; increasing penalties associated with environmental quality. Thus, in considering current and future operating costs coupled with monetisation, AD outperforms all other platforms as the most competitive resource circular initiative; providing greater sustainable operations within the biodiesel process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the simultaneous effect of microwave-ultrasound (MW + US) irradiations was compared with those of microwave (MW) and ultrasound (US) applied individually for the depolymerization of Kraft lignin in a hybrid microwave-ultrasound high pressure chemical reactor. The bio-oils obtained upon depolymerization were analyzed by GC–MS, CHNS, MALDI-TOF-MS, 2D-HSQC NMR, TGA and FTIR techniques. The highest bio-oil yield of 48.2% was obtained upon depolymerization of Kraft lignin with hybrid MW + US irradiations for 1 h under autogenous pressure while only 42.1% and 25.5% bio-oil yields were obtained for MW and US irradiations, respectively. MALDI-TOF MS spectra suggested the presence of significant amount of dimers in the bio-oil obtained over hybrid MW + US process than US and MW processes. The simultaneous effect of MW and US reduced the repolymerization of reaction intermediates thus favoring relatively low residue and high bio-oil yield. 2D-HSQC NMR demonstrated considerable degradation of the representative inter-unit linkages (β-O-4 and β-5). The HHVBoie of the bio-oils obtained over US (29.28 MJ/Kg) and MW + US (29.21 MJ/Kg) irradiations were quite comparable. Although the thermal stability of the bio-oils followed the order MW &gt; MW + US &gt; US, the bio-oil obtained over hybrid MW + US was superior in both quality and quantity than obtained over MW and US irradiations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Attainment of a stable and highly active β-xylosidase is of major importance for the efficient and cost-competitive hydrolysis of hemicellulose xylan, as well as for its industrial conversion into biofuels and biochemicals. Here, a recombinant β-xylosidase of the glycoside hydrolase family (GH43) from Bacillus subtilis was produced in Escherichia coli culture, purified, and subsequently immobilized on agarose and chitosan. Glutaraldehyde and glyoxyl groups were evaluated as activating agents to select the most efficient derivative. Multi-point immobilization on agarose led to an extraordinary thermal stability (half-lives 3604 and 164-fold higher than the free enzyme, at 50° and 35 °C, respectively). Even for chitosan activated with glutaraldehyde, a low-cost support, thermal stability of the immobilized enzyme was 326 and 12-fold higher than the free enzyme at 50° and 35°C, respectively. Immobilized enzymes showed no release of any subunit for the agarose-glyoxyl derivative, and only a few ones for the support activated with glutaraldehyde. Most remarkably, the enzyme kinetic behavior after immobilization increased up to 4-fold in relation to the free one. β-xylosidase, a tetrameric enzyme with four identical subunits, exists in equilibrium between the monomeric and oligomeric forms in solution. Depending on the pH of immobilization, the enzyme oligomerization can be favored, thus explaining the hyperactivation phenomenon. Both glyoxyl-agarose and chitosan-glutaraldehyde derivatives were used to catalyze corncob xylan hydrolysis, reaching 72 % conversion, representing a xylose productivity of around 20 g L−1 h−1. After ten 4h-cycles (pH 6.0, 35 °C), the xylan-to-xylose conversion remained approximately unchanged. Therefore, the immobilized β-xylosidases prepared in this work can be of great interest as biocatalysts in a biorefinery context. © 2020

AB  - Soybean (SB) solid residue after oil extraction was investigated in a hydrothermal modification process to provide an eco-friendly solution to SB solid waste disposal for an actual environmental management effort. SB hydrochars (HCs) were derived either by conventional heating hydrothermal treatment (HTT) under intense conditions (200, 250, and 300 °C for 2 h) or by microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment (MHTT) under mild conditions (160, 190, and 220 °C for 1 h). Physicochemical properties of SB HCs and the transformation of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) functionalities during HTT and MHTT were characterized using several tools. Ultimate and XPS analyses elucidated N transformation, e.g., 5.51 wt % N of raw SB residue decreased to 3.48 and 3.51 wt % after HTT and MHTT, respectively. The P bioavailability of raw SB (3.46 mg/g) was improved after HTT (26.7 mg/g) and MHTT (10.9 mg/g), depicting the practical application of HCs for soil amendment. Atomic H/C and O/C ratios of SB HCs decreased as treatment temperature increased. HCs showed credible higher heating value (HHV; 22.3–25.5 MJ/kg for HTT and 20.5–22.1 MJ/kg for MHTT), higher than various low-rank coals. Besides, energy densification and fuel ratio improved in intense conditions. The thermogravimetric analysis showed HCs possessed better thermal stability. The improved performance of SB HCs indicated that HTT and MHTT provided a green environmental route of SB waste management, valorization, and utilization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The application of native mixed algal strains for wastewater treatment will be investigated in this study. Native mixed algal strains will be collected from Khorda district, Odisha, India, and acclimatized to the secondary treated gray water in a stepwise manner. The algal species in the mixed strain were identified as Oscillatoria sp., Nannochloropsis limnetica, Dictyosphaerium ehrenbergianum, and Chlorella vulgaris. The mixed algal strains will be grown in different systems with combinations of natural light (N) or artificial light (A) and open system (O) or closed system (C). The mixed algal strains grew well in natural light compared with artificial light. The maximum algal biomass concentration of 0.99 and 0.79 g/L, respectively, were observed in the natural light open (NO) and natural light closed (NC) systems. In contrast, the algal strains grown in the closed system indicated improved gray water treatment compared with that of the open system. The organics [(measured as chemical oxygen demand (COD)], NO3-, and PO43- removal from gray water were 85.25%, 88.50%, and 73.12%, respectively, in the NC system. In addition, proximate analysis revealed that the biomass obtained from the NC system was slightly superior with the volatile matter, ash content, and fixed carbon of 28.5%, 69.9%, 29%, and 1.6%, respectively. In addition, the heating value of algal biomass obtained from the NC system (3.86 MJ/kg) was slightly higher than that of the NO system (3.52 MJ/kg). © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Due to abundant availability of shale gas and biogas, methane has been considered as one of the most potential carbon sources for industrial biotechnology. Methanotrophs carrying the native methane monooxygenase are capable of using methane as a sole energy and carbon source, which provides a novel strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emission and substituting edible substrates used in bioconversion processes. With the rapid development of genetic engineering tools and biosynthesis techniques, various strategies for improving the efficiency of methane bioconversion have been achieved to produce a variety of commodity bio-based products. Herein, we summarize several important aspects related with methane utilization and metabolic engineering of methanotrophs, including the modification of methane oxidation pathways, the construction of efficient cell factories, and biosynthesis of chemicals and fuels. Finally, the prospects and challenges of the future development of methane bioconversion are also discussed. © 2021 Chin J Biotech, All rights reserved

AB  - Methane, one of the six major greenhouse gases, poses a serious environmental problem with the potential for global warming 20 times that of CO2. Although a large amount of methane is generated worldwide, its recovery and utilization are very low. One of the environmentally friendly ways to use methane is the biological gas-to-liquids (Bio-GTL) process, in which methane is biologically converted to useful products by microorganisms. Methanotrophs are strains that can convert methane to methanol at ambient conditions using methane monooxygenase (MMO). Here, we report an efficient phase-transfer catalysis system for methane-to-methanol conversion using methanotrophs. The methanotroph used in the work is Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z of which the methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) enzyme is removed to enhance methanol accumulation. The phase-transfer catalysis system does not require any separation processes and facilitates the mass transfer of methane gas, thereby increasing the methanol productivity and lowering the production cost. The methanol productivity is 0.717 g/L/h, which is superior to the results reported to date. In addition, the use of a cellulose-membrane reactor system enables multiple biocatalytic reactions without a significant decrease in productivity. © 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - The fermentation of biomass allows for the generation of major renewable ethanol biofuel that has high energy density favorable for direct alcohol fuel cells in alkaline media. However, selective conversion of ethanol to either CO2 or acetate remains a great challenge. Especially, the ethanol-to-acetate route usually demonstrates decentoxidation current density relative to the ethanol-to-CO2 route that contains strongly adsorbed poisons. This makes the total oxidation of ethanol to CO2 unnecessary. Here, we present a highly active ethanol oxidation electrocatalyst that was prepared by in situ decorating highly dispersed Mo sites on Pd nanosheets (MoOx/Pd) via a surfactant-free and facile route. We found that μ2 atom % of Mo on Pd nanosheets increases the current density to 3.8 A mgPd-1, around 2 times more active relative to the undecorated Pd nanosheets, achieving nearly 100% faradic efficiency for the ethanol-to-acetate conversion in an alkaline electrolyte without the generation of detectable CO2, evidenced by in situ electrochemical infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and ion chromatography. The selective and CO2-free conversion offers a promising strategy through alcohol fuel cells for contributing comparable current density to power electrical equipment while for selective oxidation of biofuels to useful acetate intermediate for the chemical industry. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The application of renewable jet fuel is an eco-friendly technique that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Based on existing commercial processes, this study aimed to evaluate the hydro-conversion processes for producing renewable jet fuel. Three process scenarios were compared, in which the feedstock used cooking oil (UCO) is converted to hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) and its byproducts. Then, the investment feasibility of the three processes was evaluated through an economic analysis and predicted by an uncertainty analysis. The results show that if the main product (HRJ) is the profit target, one-step conversion is the best choice. However, if we consider the overall economic benefits, the three-step conversion method is more suitable with an average more 11.94% chance of profiting than the one-stage under uncertain analysis, which means it is a considerably competitive approach with lower risk and only 0.31 $/L of minimum selling price of jet fuel (MJSP), because it has the advantages of a wider range application and higher value of byproducts which reduce the risk of a single factor contribution. From the sensitivity analysis, jet fuel price is the key factor which contributes 75–82% for one- and two-stage processes, but UCO price in three-stage process reach nearly 50%. In addition, due to the economic scale, scaling up the plant capacity will lead higher economic benefits. Therefore, an efficient UCO recovery system and three-stage process are the keys for the industrial development aspect through the value-chain analysis under uncertainty. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Over the past two decades, the designs of redox polymers have become critical to the field of mediated bioelectrocatalysis and are used in commercial glucose biosensors, as well as other bioelectrochemical applications (e.g., energy harvesting). These polymers are specifically used to immobilize redox mediators on electrode surfaces, allowing for self-exchange-based conduction of electrons from enzymes far from the electrode to the electrode surface. However, the synthesis of redox polymers is challenging and results in large batch-to-batch variability. Herein, we report a rapid entrapment of mediators for NAD+-dependent bioelectrocatalysis within reverse ionically condensed polyelectrolytes. A high ionic strength aqueous solution of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, composed of cationic polyguanidinium (PG) chloride and anionic sodium hexametaphosphate (P6), undergoes phase inversion into a solid microporous polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) when introduced into a low ionic strength aqueous solution. The ionic strength-triggered phase inversion of PGP6 solutions was investigated as a means to entrap mediators on the surface of electrodes for mediated bioelectrocatalysis. Compared to the traditional cross-linked immobilizations using redox polymers, this phase inversion takes place within seconds and requires up to 60 min for complete stabilization. In this work, redox mediator phenazine ethosulfate (PES) was entrapped within PGP6 on electrode surfaces for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent bioelectrocatalysis. In the bulk solution, NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase enzymes catalyze the oxidation of the substrate while reducing NAD to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The resulting NADH is reoxidized to NAD+ by the entrapped PES that gets reduced on the electrode, completing the NAD+-regeneration-based bioelectrocatalysis. To show the use of these new materials in an application, biofuel cells were evaluated using four different anodic enzyme systems (alcohol dehydrogenase, lactate hydrogenase, glycerol dehydrogenase, and glucose dehydrogenase). © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This paper deals with the state and perspectives of bioenergy development in the context of exploiting the potential of available natural resources. We analyse the economic benefits of transitioning to alternative biofuel within the research task in cooperation with the Vojany black coal power plant. Within the applied methodology, a non-parametric data envelopment analysis method was used to confirm the most economically efficient types of fuels used in the combustion process. The assumption of fuel efficiency was confirmed by testing fuel combustion combinations directly in the power plant. The transition to 100% combustion of solid recovered fuel creates the potential for sustainable production of the analysed power plant and compliance with the current emission values of basic pollutants and new stricter limits, which will be binding in the EU from August 2021. The proposed solutions were analysed by Monte Carlo simulation. An estimate of the economic results achieved by the power plant was simulated, assuming a complete transition to solid recovered fuel. The results of the study support the feasibility of creating a circular waste management market, with the Vojany black coal power plant as the largest user of solid recovered fuel in Slovakia and abroad. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Increasing energy needs have led to soaring fossil fuel consumption, which has caused several environmental problems. These environmental aspects along with the energy demand have motivated the search for new energy systems. In this context, biofuels such as biodiesel have been developing into a substitute for conventional fuels. Microalgae are considered a promising option for biodiesel production due to their high lipid content. Therefore, it is important to analyze the technical aspects of the biodiesel production system. In this work, the inherent safety analysis of three emerging topologies for biodiesel production from microalgae was performed using the inherent safety index (ISI) methodology. Selected topologies include biodiesel production via lipid extraction and transesterification, in-situ transesterification, and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The results revealed that the processes are inherently unsafe achieving total inherent safety index scores of 30, 29, and 36. The main risks in the cases were associated with the chemical safety index. Operating conditions represented no risk for topologies 1 and 2, while for topology 3 pressure and temperature were identified as critical variables. In general, topology 2 showed better performance from a safety perspective. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The limitation of fossil fuel sources and negative environmental impact persuade scientists around the world to find a solution. One possible solution is by using renewable fuel to replace fossil fuel with an inexpensive, fast, and effective production process. The objective of this study is to investigate the biodiesel production from crude Reutealis trisperma oil using the conventional and the ultrasonic bath stirrer method through the esterification and transesterification process. The result shows that the most effective reaction time with an optimum condition for the esterification and transesterification of Reutealis trisperma oil is at 2 h 30 min by using the ultrasonic bath stirrer method. The optimum conditions at a temperature of 55◦ C for the esterification and at 60◦ C for transesterification with 2% (v/v) of sulphuric acid with catalyst concentration of 0.5 wt.% were a methanol-to-oil ratio of 60%, and agitation speed of 1000 rpm. This optimum condition gives the highest yield of 95.29% for the Reutealis trisperma biodiesel. The results showed that the ultrasonic bath stirrer method had more effect on the reaction time needed than using the conventional method and reduced half of the conventional method reaction time. Finally, the properties of Reutealis trisperma biodiesel fulfilled the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 biodiesel standards with density, 892 kg/m3; pour point, −2◦ C; cloud point, −1◦ C; flash point, 206.5◦ C; calorific value, 40.098 MJ/kg; and acid value, 0.26 mg KOH/g. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Organosolv fractionation is a promising approach for the separation of lignocellulosic components in integrated biorefineries where each component can be fully valorized into valuable platform chemicals and biofuels. In this study, microwave-accelerated organosolv fractionation was developed for the modification of lignocellulosic fractionation of rice husk. The fractionation condition was optimized for 1 h with the microwave irradiation at 300 W using a ternary solvent mixture composed of 24%:32%:44% water/ethanol/methyl isobutyl ketone. The effects of mineral acids (HCl, H3PO4, and H2SO4) and heterogeneous acid promoters (HCl, H3PO4, and H2SO4 impregnated over activated carbon) on the efficiency and selectivity of product yields (i.e., glucan, hemicellulose-derived products, and lignin) were also investigated. It was found that the use of H3PO4-activated carbon as the promoter showed superior performance on the fractionation of rice husk components, resulting in 88.8% recovery of cellulose, with 63.8% purity in the solid phase, whereas the recovery of hemicellulose (66.4%) with the lowest formation of furan and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural and lignin (81.0%) without sugar cross-contamination was obtained in the aqueous ethanol phase and organic phase, respectively. In addition, the morphology structure of fractionated rice husk presented 2.6-fold higher surface area (5.4 m2/g) of cellulose-enriched fraction in comparison with the native rice husk (2.1 m2/g), indicating the improvement of enzyme accessibility. Besides, the chemical changes of isolated lignin were also investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. This work gives pieces of information into the efficiencies of the microwave strategy as a climate neighborly elective fractionation method for this serious starting material in the biotreatment facility business. ©

AB  - Today one of the most interesting ways to produce biodiesel is based on the use of oleaginous microorganisms, which can accumulate microbial oil with a composition similar to vegetable oils. In this paper, we present a thermo-chemical numerical model of the yeast biodiesel production process, considering cardoon stalks as raw material. The simulation is performed subdividing the process into the following sections: steam explosion pre-treatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, lipid production, lipid extraction, and alkali-catalyzed transesterification. Numerical results show that 406.4 t of biodiesel can be produced starting from 10,000 t of lignocellulosic biomass. An economic analysis indicates a biodiesel production cost of 12.8 USD/kg, thus suggesting the need to increase the capacity plant and the lipid yield to make the project economically attractive. In this regard, a sensitivity analysis is also performed considering an ideal lipid yield of 22% and 100,000 t of lignocellulosic biomass. The biodiesel production costs related to these new scenarios are 7.88 and 5.91 USD/kg, respectively. The large capacity plant combined with a great lipid yield in the fermentation stage shows a biodiesel production cost of 3.63 USD/kg making the product competitive on the current market of biofuels by microbial oil. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Microbial electrosynthesis is a new approach to converting C1 carbon (CO2) to more complex carbon-based products. In the present study, CO2, a potential greenhouse gas, was used as a sole carbon source and reduced to value-added chemicals (acetate, ethanol) with the help of bioelectrochemical reduction in microbial electrosynthesis systems (MES). The performance of MES was studied with varying electrode materials (carbon felt, stainless steel, and cobalt electrodeposited carbon felt). The MES performance was assessed in terms of acetic acid and ethanol production with the help of gas chromatography (GC). The electrochemical characterization of the system was analyzed with chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry. The study revealed that the MES operated with hybrid cobalt electrodeposited carbon felt electrode yielded the highest acetic acid (4.4 g/L) concentration followed by carbon felt/stainless steel (3.7 g/L), plain carbon felt (2.2 g/L), and stainless steel (1.87 g/L). The alcohol concentration was also observed to be highest for the hybrid electrode (carbon felt/stainless steel/cobalt oxide is 0.352 g/L) as compared to the bare electrodes (carbon felt is 0.22 g/L) tested, which was found to be in correspondence with the pH changes in the system. Electrochemical analysis revealed improved electrotrophy in the hybrid electrode, as confirmed by the increased redox current for the hybrid electrode as compared to plain electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry analysis also confirmed the role of the biocatalyst developed on the electrode in CO2 sequestration. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In the present research, activated carbon-supported sulfonic acid catalysts were synthesized and tested as pretreatment agents for the conversion of switchgrass into glucose. The catalysts were synthesized by reacting sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, and p-toluenesulfonic acid with activated carbon. The characterization of catalysts suggested an increase in surface acidities, while surface area and pore volumes decreased because of sulfonation. Batch experiments were performed in 125 mL serum bottles to investigate the effects of temperature (30, 60, and 90◦C), reaction time (90 and 120 min) on the yields of glucose. Enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated switchgrass using Ctec2 yielded up to 57.13% glucose. Durability tests indicated that sulfonic solid-impregnated carbon catalysts were able to maintain activity even after three cycles. From the results obtained, the solid acid catalysts appear to serve as effective pretreatment agents and can potentially reduce the use of conventional liquid acids and bases in biomass-into-biofuel production. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, the optimization of microwave-assisted alkaline (MAA) pretreatment is performed to attain the opti-mal operating parameters for the delignification of cocoa pod husk (CPH). The MAA performance was examined by heating the CPH solid with different particle sizes (60-120 mesh) and NaOH solution with a different sample to a solvent (SS) ratio (0.02-0.05 g/L), for short irradiation time (1-4 min). Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was utilized to optimize the percentage of lignocellulose composition changes. The results show that by enlarging particle size, the content of lignin and cellulose decreased while hemicellulose increased. By prolong irradiation time, the content of lignin and hemicellulose decreased while cellulose elevated. On the other hand, increasing the SS ratio was not significant for hemicellulose content changes. From FTIR and SEM characterization, the MAA drove the removal of lignin and hemicellulose of CPH and increased cellulose slightly. Supported by kinetic study which conducted in this work, it was exhibited that MAA pretreatment technology is an effective delignification method of CPH which can tackle the bottleneck of its commercial biofuel production.

AB  - Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are usually appended to carbohydrateactive enzymes (CAZymes) and serve to potentiate catalytic activity, for example, by increasing substrate affinity. The Gram-negative soil saprophyte Cellvibrio japonicus is a valuable source for CAZyme and CBM discovery and characterization due to its innate ability to degrade a wide array of plant polysaccharides. Bioinformatic analysis of the CJA_2959 gene product from C. japonicus revealed a modular architecture consisting of a fibronectin type III (Fn3) module, a cryptic module of unknown function (X181), and a glycoside hydrolase family 5 subfamily 4 (GH5_4) catalytic module. We previously demonstrated that the last of these, CjGH5F, is an efficient and specific endo-xyloglucanase (M. A. Attia, C. E. Nelson, W. A. Offen, N. Jain, et al., Biotechnol Biofuels 11:45, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-018-1039-6). In the present study, C-terminal fusion of superfolder green fluorescent protein in tandem with the Fn3X181 modules enabled recombinant production and purification from Escherichia coli. Native affinity gel electrophoresis revealed binding specificity for the terminal galactosecontaining plant polysaccharides galactoxyloglucan and galactomannan. Isothermal titration calorimetry further evidenced a preference for galactoxyloglucan polysaccharide over short oligosaccharides comprising the limit-digest products of CjGH5F. Thus, our results identify the X181 module as the defining member of a new CBM family, CBM88. In addition to directly revealing the function of this CBM in the context of xyloglucan metabolism by C. japonicus, this study will guide future bioinformatic and functionalanalyses across microbial (meta)genomes. © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - The most difficult hindrance to use biodiesel is its expensive price because of the costly edible feedstocks such as soybean oil. Also, the production of biodiesel from edible feedstocks competes with the food supply causing a rise in food prices. Therefore, using the cheap waste feedstocks such as used cooking oil makes the biodiesel price inexpensive. However, the waste feedstocks have great quantities of free fatty acids (FFAs) that form soap and destroy the biodiesel properties while reacting with the base catalyst in the transesterification reaction. Consequently, a treatment step is required to reduce FFAs content below 1 wt %; thus, the base transesterification reaction can be implemented without soap formation. In this work, two types of feedstocks that had 2.82 and 2 wt % of FFAs were treated by the glycerolysis reaction at a temperature of 150 °C using two types of glycerol; the crude glycerol –a by-product in the biodiesel production process after its purification– or the pure glycerol. After the treatment, the FFAs quantity decreased below 1 wt % that was suitable for base transesterification reaction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Enzyme consumption is a key cost in the lignocellulosic sugar route for production of biofuels and chemicals, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a low-cost additive that improves hydrolysis efficiency. Despite many studies in this area, the relation of benefit over cost of PEG addition remains unclear. This article describes principles for expressing the effect of PEG as an equivalent enzyme amount, by merging PEG adsorption kinetics with a standardized enzyme dosage response. This model allows cost optimization of PEG addition by marginal analysis, as a function of enzyme dosage, solids concentration and price-ratio of enzyme and PEG. The model is based on the novel observations that the relative increase in apparent enzyme dosage by PEG addition is constant regardless of the absolute enzyme dosage, and that the increase correlates linearly with adsorption of PEG on hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw. The optimum ranged for most cases between 7 and 14 mg PEG per g substrate. The addition of PEG was attractive only above a threshold price-ratio, which decreased from 7.0–1.4 as enzyme dosage increased from 2 to 10 cost units per g substrate, showing that the incentive for introducing PEG to the process becomes stronger as the enzyme dosage increases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ethanol produced from renewable biomass, such as lignocellulosic feedstock, is one of the most promising future biofuels. In this paper, rapeseed straw was tested as an abundant and cost-effective renewable resource material for the production of cellulosic glucose. Pre-treatment of this material is an important step to improve the efficiency of subsequent cellulose hydrolysis. In this study, we used two pre-treatment methods – hydrothermochemical and ultrasound. Studies have shown that, in the initial hydrothermal pre-treatment of rapeseed straw, Al2(SO4)3 may be used as an efficient catalyst, at least in procedures for obtaining glucose. An increase in the amount of this catalyst was accompanied by higher yields of both furfural and glucose. Additional pre-treatment of lignocellulosic residue with ultrasound resulted in considerable improvements in the results from further enzymatic hydrolysis. The application of two enzymes at the hydrolysis stage also increased the amount of glucose obtained. It was shown that the additional use of ultrasound increased the glucose amount by 21–29 % after enzymatic hydrolysis with two types of enzymes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research, for the first time a mixture of diesel-biodiesel-water-bionanoparticles was prepared to simultaneously optimize the fuel consumption, reduce pollutant emission, and enhance the performance of diesel engines. To this end, graphene quantum dots as biodegradable nanoparticles were synthesized through the hydrothermal method. In this respective, the synthesized quantum dot nanoparticles were added at the concentrations of 20, 60, and 100 ppm along with 1, 5, and 10 vol% distilled water to the B15 fuel (the diesel fuel containing 15 vol% biodiesel). The results obtained from the engine experiments exhibited that when water and quantum dots were added simultaneously to the B15 fuel, the engine power was increased and the brake specific fuel consumption was reduced. In addition, the emissions of pollutants including HC, NOx and soot were decreased. However, the soot emission was slightly increased by adding the nanoparticles. For the sample containing 5% water and 60 ppm graphene quantum dot nanoparticles, the engine power was improved by 13.6% and the brake specific fuel consumption was reduced by 7.8% compared to those of the B15 pure fuel. Furthermore, emissions of pollutants including NOx, HC, and soot were decreased by 3.8, 29.2, and 33.7%, respectively, compared with the B15 pure fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are starting materials for the production of biolipid-based fuels such as biodiesel and biojet fuel. While various microorganisms can produce TAGs from renewable resources, the cultivation of TAG-producing microorganisms under sterilization conditions to avoid microbial contamination and application of solvent to extract TAGs from the TAG-filled microorganisms are costly. To overcome these challenges, this study reports the feasibility of a non-sterile cultivation of an oleaginous bacterium Rhodococcus opacus PD631SpAHB under saline conditions, followed by the use of a solvent-free, phage-lysis-protein-based bioextraction approach for TAGs release. The engineered strain PD631SpAHB was developed by introducing a recombinant plasmid carrying a phage lytic gene cassette (pAHB) into Rhodococcus opacus PD631 via transformation, followed by adaptive evolution under saline conditions. This newly developed strain is a salt-tolerant strain with the inducible plasmid pAHB to enable TAGs release into the supernatant upon induction. Cell lysis of PD631SpAHB was confirmed by the decrease of the optical density of cell suspension, by the loss of cell membrane integrity, and by the detection of TAGs in the culture medium. Up to 38% of the total TAGs accumulated in PD631SpAHB was released into supernatant after the expression of the lytic genes. PD631SpAHB strain is a promising candidate to produce TAGs from non-sterile growth medium and release of its TAGs without solvent extraction - a new approach to reduce the overall cost of biolipid-based biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the key issues in the development of biofuels using lignocellulosic feedstocks is to increase the yield of fermented sugar, and simultaneously decrease the generation of fermentation inhibitors. Therefore, it is essential to understand the degradation mechanism of xylan during hot-water pretreatment. We analyzed the hydrothermal degradation products of xylan and xylose under different conditions. Results showed that furfural and formic acid formed from xylose reached a maximum value of 32.56 % and 35.14 %, respectively. By increasing the initial pH of the xylan solution, the furfural concentration can be reduced effectively to 2% and the formation of formic acid was preferred under alkaline conditions. On this basis, we proposed a new hydrothermal degradation pathway of xylan in alkaline solution. The in-depth understanding of xlyan degradation during hot water pre-treatment will be beneficial for improving the efficiency of biofuel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ceiba pentandra, non-edible oil (acid value of 21 mg KOH/g estimated using ASTM D664 methodology) is employed as a source for producing biodiesel using lipase immobilized on mesoporous material as a catalyst. Optimum conditions for maximum yield (96.4%) were the temperature of 33 °C, methanol to oil molar ratio of about 13.3:1 with a water content of 14.5%. From the reusability studies, it can be observed that greater than 85% conversion could be obtained up to 10 cycles, thereby proving the significant efficacy of the catalyst. Density, flash point, cloud point, calorific value, and cetane number of the produced biodiesels were 885 kg/m3, 152 °C, −3 °C, 38.44 kJ/kg and 57.2, respectively meeting the ASTM standards specified for biodiesel. The performance and emissions characteristics of 20% biodiesel (CIB20) and petroleum diesel were studied in a VCR under varying speeds in a full load condition. Blended biofuel showed a 13% lower mean brake power (BP) and 25% higher mean specific fuel consumption (SFC) compared to diesel fuel. Though NOx emission of the blended diesel was 31% higher than that of petroleum diesel, Hydrocarbon, CO2, and CO emissions were 8.4%, 13.7%, and 5.08% lower than that of diesel fuel, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Accurate knowledge of the components in the purification of biodiesel is important in achieving consistency in quality for the separation and purification process. In this paper, ternary phase diagrams were used to study the phase separation and purification of tropical almond biodiesel at temperatures of 20 °C, 30 °C and 40 °C. The biodiesel was produced using alkaline transesterification of the seed oil. The biodiesel was characterized using ASTM and EN standard methods. A modified cloud point titration procedure under constant temperature was used to determine the tie lines and binodal compositions. The phase mixture compositions were determined using gas chromatographic method. Distribution coefficient and selectivity analysis were performed and data accuracy, consistency and reliability were done using a first-order linear polynomial model. The result revealed free fatty acid values for the oil and the biodiesel as 0.63 and 0.23 respectively. The data quality and reliability showed a high coefficient of determination of 0.9998, adjusted coefficient of determination of 0.9887, a standard deviation of 0.0327, and a correlation coefficient of 0.8349 at the investigated temperatures. Methanol was prevalent in the glycerol phase. Ternary phase diagrams provided the visual means of estimating the distribution of the components. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel biosynthesis with enzymatic transesterification is considered green, sustainable, and environmentally friendly method. Lipase from Burkholderia cepacia G63 has excellent catalytic properties in biodiesel production. Lipase chaperones promote secretion and folding of enzymes, thereby enhancing enzymatic activity. In the current study, heterologous co-expression of lipase (lipA) and chaperone (lipB) was achieved in Escherichia coli through codon optimization. The enzymatic activity of purified and renatured lipAB was 2080.23 ± 19.18 U/g at 50 °C and pH 8.0. Moreover, lipAB showed increased resistance to pH and temperature changes, and lipAB retained stable catalytic properties after treatment with metal ions, organic solvents, and surfactants, namely Mg2+, methanol, and Triton-100X. Besides, using recombinant lipase lipAB as catalysts, biodiesel was synthesized using rapeseed oil under 50 °C for 72 h with a yield of 90.23%. Thus, the current study confirmed that co-expression of lipase and its chaperone is an effective strategy to enhance enzyme activity and improve the biochemical profile, meanwhile, showing that lipAB is a promising biocatalyst for biodiesel production. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As two renewable oxygenated biofuels, 2,5-dimethylfuran and 2-methylfuran (DMF and MF) have been considered to be two of the most potential fuels in the future due to the development of the second-generation biosynthetic technologies. The atmosphere pyrolysis experiments with 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% replacement of ethylene by DMF/MF at 1173 and 1273 K were conducted. Collected soot samples were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to acquire their internal structure and oxidation reactivity. Results showed that soot mass was positively related with DMF addition ratios and the reaction temperature. Soot production was also enhanced when the MF addition ratio gradually increased from 0% to 75%. The influences of DMF addition can promote soot formation more obviously than MF. Temperatures showed a more significant influence on soot morphology than fuel types and DMF/MF addition ratios. For a fixed addition ratio of DMF/MF, soot showed liquid-like substances at 1173 K. At 1273 K, approximately round particles formed and linked together in chains. Moreover, at 1273 K, the aggregates obtained by adding MF contained more single particles, longer carbon chains, and larger projection area compared with the aggregates by adding same MF. For nanostructures, as the addition ratios of DMF/MF increased, as well as the reaction temperature improved, the fringe length of the carbon layer increased, the average fringe tortuosity decreased, and the stacking arrangement of soot became more orderly, the soot oxidation reactivity was lower. Under a same addition ratio and reaction temperature, soot obtained by adding DMF possessed slightly longer fringe length, smaller fringe tortuosity and lower oxidation reactivity than those of the soot obtained by adding MF. High correlation between fringe parameters and soot oxidation reactivity was discovered. The more ordered soot nanostructure, the longer fringe length, and the smaller fringe tortuosity could make the oxidation reactivity of soot get lower. © 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Second-generation biofuels prove to be a distinctive and renewable source of sustainable energy and cleaner environment. The current study focuses on the exploration and identification of four nonedible sources, that is, Brassica oleracea L., Carthamus oxyacantha M.Bieb., Carthamus tinctorius L., and Beaumontia grandiflora Wall., utilizing light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for studying the detailed micromorphological features of these seeds. LM revealed that size ranges from 3 to 20 mm. furthermore, a great variety of color is observed from pitch black to greenish gray and yellowish white to off white. Seeds ultrastructure study with the help of SEM revealed a great variety in shape, size, color, sculpturing and periclinal wall shape, and so on. Followed by the production of fatty acid methyl esters from a novel source, that is, seeds oil of Brassica oleracea L. (seed oil content 42.20%, FFA content 0.329 mg KOH/g) using triple metal impregnated montmorillonite clay catalyst (Cu-Mg-Zn-Mmt). Catalyst was characterized using SEM–EDX, FT-IR. Maximum yield of Brassica oleracea L. biodiesel (87%) was obtained at the conditions; 1:9 of oil to methanol ratio, 0.5 g of catalyst, 5 hr reaction time, and 90°C of temperature. Synthesized biodiesel was characterized by FT-IR, GC–MS, and NMR. Fuel properties of the Brassica oleracea L. FAMES were determined and found in accordance with ASTM standards. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - The exhaust emissions from the compression ignition engines are harmful to both human beings and the environment. After-treatment devices placed in the exhaust are designed to reduce these emissions. These devices have significant conversion efficiency but have various drawbacks such as the cost and availability of the precious catalyst for catalytic converters. In this work, an emission reduction setup was developed that can reduce NO, HC, CO and smoke simultaneously. The emission reduction setup is based on the concept of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and plasma generation by corona discharge technique. Both diesel and waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCO) were separately used for the test. The results show that HC emissions at full load with ESP system reduced from 0.71 to 0.27 g/kWh for diesel and for WCO it reduced from 0.81 to 0.31 g/kWh. Similarly, the CO emissions reduced from 1.50 to 0.6 g/kWh for diesel and from 1.95 to 0.92 g/kWh for WCO. The smoke emission and NO emission were also reduced by 30.86 and 29.3% for diesel and WCO and 17 and 18% for diesel and WCO, respectively. However, the carbon dioxide emissions were found to increase as the HC and CO generated were also converted to CO2. The study shows that the emission reduction setup can effectively reduce the emissions without any effect on the engine performance. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived lignin sources is highly important for the conversion of renewable biomass resources to biofuels. However, lots of developed catalysts suffer from the drawbacks of expensive precious metal catalysts and/or operation under harsh conditions. In the present work, Co-Ni bimetallic catalysts were prepared and applied in catalyzing hydrogenolysis of Caryl-O aromatic ethers with high activities under the promotion of Nb2C MXene additive. Especially, the hydrogenolysis of diphenyl ether (DPE), a 4-O-5 model compound, to cyclohexane (cy) and cyclohexyl alcohol (cy-ol) could be achieved over the Co2Ni1Ox-Nb2C MXene catalytic system at 120 °C and under 5 bar of H2, which are mild conditions in comparison with those for the developed heterogeneous precious-metal-free catalysts. The excellent catalytic performances stemmed from the strong interaction between Co and Ni species and the promotion of Lewis acidic sites offered by Nb2C MXene. The proposed reaction pathway involved the direct hydrogenolysis of DPE route, in which DPE was initially hydrogenolyzed to benzene and phenol. They were further hydrogenated to cy and cy-ol. The present work not only develops a noble-metal-free bimetallic catalyst for utilization of biomass-derived lignin sources, but also provides a novel strategy for using the Nb2C MXene material. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - As a typical second-generation diesel biofuel, HRD-76 has received extensive attention. The components of 2, 6, 10-trimethyl dodecane and n-hexadecane were selected and formulated by directly matching functional group information from the nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR)spectroscopy analysis. Then, the chemical reaction mechanism was developed and validated. At last, the simplicity and accuracy were demonstrated by comparing the calculations against experimental data and predictions of other surrogate model for ignition delay times under several initial conditions. The development of surrogate fuel will lay the foundation for deeply understanding the combustion mechanism of HRD-76, and creating an opportunity to study the reaction flow process by simulations. © 2021, Editorial Office of the Journal of Combustion Science and Technology.

AB  - Single-atom biological catalysts have attracted enormous attentions for low cost, high stability and catalytic activity in therapeutics and biomedical devices. The properties of Fe atom substituted CaII in HAP surface (Fe@HAP) and Fe adsorbed over HAP surface (Fe/HAP), and the detailed kinetic and thermodynamic behaviors of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) processes have been investigated by using the first-principles study. It is found that Fe dopant by substituted CaII ion into HAP surface could be more stably anchored at HAP surface than Fe adsorbate, and the introduced Fe dopant can enormously increase the endogenous ORR catalytic activity of magnetic HAP catalysts. Furthermore, the ORR process on Fe@HAP prefers to the 4e- pathway with the small reaction barrier (0.73 eV) for the rate-limiting step, and the two OH species formed from the hydrogenation of the adsorbed O2 prefer to further hydrogenate into two H2O molecules and their self-dehydrogenation is not preferable according to the transition states simulation, which is also confirmed by the Gibbs free energy calculation. Consequently, our results revealed that the Fe@HAP could be an efficient catalyst as cathode material in the applications of the implantable biofuel cells and shed light on the design of biomaterials for various applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, a two-stage liquefaction-hydrogenation approach was devised to produce low-oxygenated bio-fuel from lignocellulose. At the first stage, lignocellulose was liquefied in CO/H2O/EtOH system without catalyst at 250 °C and 12 h to produce bio-crude (BC). Around 55 wt% of bio-crude and approximately 1 wt% lignocellulose solid residue (LSR) could be obtained after liquefaction. It indicated that a low-LSR liquefaction of lignocellulose with acceptably high yield of bio-crude could be achieved under low temperature, as long as long reaction time served. It also suggested that water–gas shift reaction improved BC yield and suppressed LSR formation. At the second stage, the deoxygenation of the bio-crude was then employed in MeOH/CuZnAl-2 system at 330 °C and 6 h with the aid from n-C6H14 and Ni/HZSM-5 to produce the low-oxygenated bio-fuel (LOBF). Notably, without coke formation, the overall yield of the LOBF reached 36.73 wt% with 7.80 wt% of oxygen content, while the HHV of the LOBF reached 40.92 MJ/kg. It was found that MeOH played a role as hydrogen donor for hydrogenation to directly decrease oxygen content and carbon source for alkylation to indirectly decrease oxygen content. Moreover, the n-C6H14 added to methanol contributed to deep deoxygenation of bio-crude, although it had no ability of supplying hydrogen. GC × GC-TOF-MS analysis indicated that the dominant products of the LOBF were hydrocarbons and polymethylphenols. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis showed that there were no big fragments in the LOBF. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis oil (PO) is an inexpensive biofuel produced via the fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. However, PO is unstable and has low energy density, making it unsuitable as a fuel in conventional engines without upgrading. Supercritical methanol depolymerization and hydrodeoxygenation were used to convert PO to a mixture of alkanes and alcohols in a continuous packed-bed reaction using the CuMgAlOx catalyst. The PO was pretreated at low temperature to convert acids, aldehydes, and ketones. The pretreated PO was converted continuously for 11 h until the packed bed plugged from coke formation. The catalyst deactivated over time from the deposition of high molecular weight pyrolytic lignin (PL) species. Oxygenates and anhydrosugars in the sugar-rich aqueous fraction of PO were converted to C2-C6 alcohols, esters, and ethers through a mixed hydrodeoxygenation and Guerbet coupling reaction pathway. PL was converted to a mixture of oxygenated aromatics including naphthenes and cyclohexanols. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Biobutanol is a renewable, less polluting, and potentially viable alternative fuel to conventional gasoline. Biobutanol can be produced from same sources as bioethanol, and it has many advantages over the widespread bioethanol. This paper systematically analyzes biobutanol fuel as an alternative to bioethanol in alcohol-gasoline mixtures and the physicochemical properties. Based on the conducted analyses, it was found that biobutanol mixtures have a more suitable behavior of vapor pressure without the occurrence of azeotrope, do not form a separate phase in lower temperature, it has higher energy density, but slightly reduce the octane number and a have higher viscosity. However, in general, biobutanol has many advantageous properties that could allow its use in gasoline engines instead of the commonly used bioethanol. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesels and biolubricants are synthetic esters produced mainly via a transesterification of other esters from bio-based resources, such as plant-based oils or animal fats. Microwave heating has been used to enhance transesterification reaction by converting an electrical energy into a radiation, becoming part of the internal energy acquired by reactant molecules. This method leads to major energy savings and reduces the reaction time by at least 60% compared to a conventional heating via conduction and convection. However, the application of microwave heating technology alone still suffers from non-homogeneous electromagnetic field distribution, thermally unstable rising temperatures, and insufficient depth of microwave penetration, which reduces the mass transfer efficiency. The strategy of integrating multiple technologies for biodiesel and biolubricant production has gained a great deal of interest in applied chemistry. This review presents an advanced transesterification process that combines microwave heating with other technologies, namely an acoustic cavitation, a vacuum, ionic solvent, and a supercritical/subcritical approach to solve the limitations of the stand-alone microwave-assisted transesterification. The combined technologies allow for the improvement in the overall product yield and energy efficiency. This review provides insights into the broader prospects of microwave heating in the production of bio-based products. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Biofuel production from microalgae non-food feedstock is a challenge for strengthening Green energy nowadays. Reviewing the current technology, there is still reluctance in investing towards the production of new algal strains that yield more oil and maximize capital gains. In the current work, the microalgal feedstock selection problem is investigated for increased lipid production and nano-catalytic conversion into clean biofuel. For that purpose, a variety of Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making processes and a multitude of Optimization criteria spanning to technological, environmental, economic, and social aspects are used. The strains selected for the analysis are Chlorella sp., Schizochytrium sp., Spirulina sp., and Nannochloropsis sp. The methods applied are fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, FTOPSIS (fuzzy technique for the order of preference to the ideal solution), and FCM (fuzzy cognitive mapping). Pairwise comparison matrices were calculated using data from extensive literature review. All aforementioned fuzzy logic methodologies are proven superior to their numeric equivalent under uncertain factors that affect the decision making, such as cost, policy implications, and also geographical and seasonal variation. A major finding is that the most dominant factor in the strain selection is the high lipid content. Moreover, the results indicate that the Chlorella Vulgaris microalgae is ranked as the best choice by the FTOPSIS method followed by the Nannochloropsis strain, and Spirulina Platensis was found to be the last in performance. The best and worst case scenario run with FCM experimentally verify this choice indicating that Chlorella Vulgaris follows this trend of selection mostly with the technological and the economic criteria for both the sigmoid and the hyperbolic tangent deep-learning functions used. © Copyright © 2021 Kokkinos, Karayannis and Moustakas.

AB  - Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is an interesting blending component for diesel fuel (D) owing to the high oxygen content (53 wt.%) and the absence of C-C bonds in its structure. Moreover, DMC can be produced from CO2 and methanol, which provides a renewable way to reduce anthropogenic CO2. This research has been addressed to assess the use of DMC as a solvent of sunflower oil (SO) and castor oil (CO), with the purpose of obtaining biofuels that can replace fossil diesel as much as possible. The blending of DMC with straight vegetable oils (SVOs) reduces their high viscosity, allowing their usage as drop-in biofuels without chemical treatments. Based on viscosity requirements of European Standard EN 590, the optimal DMC/SVO double blends have been tested as direct biofuels by themselves or mixed with fossil diesel in D/DMC/SVO triple blends. Relevant physico-chemical properties of fuels have been analyzed. Engine parameters such as power output, brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and soot emissions have been studied to determine the effect of new biofuels on efficiency of a diesel engine. An outstanding engine efficiency is shown by the studied D/DMC/SVO triple blends, either with SO or CO as an SVO. The low calorific value of DMC is the main reason for reduction in power and BSFC, as the amount of diesel in the triple blends is reduced. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of these biofuels allows the replacement of up to 40% of fossil diesel, without compromising the power and BSFC of the engine, and accomplishing optimal cold flow properties and a marked drop in exhaust emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effect of the port injection of ammonia on performance, knock and NOx emission across a range of engine speeds in a gasoline/ethanol dual-fuel engine. An experimentally validated numerical model of a naturally aspirated spark-ignition (SI) engine was developed in AVL BOOST for the purpose of this investigation. The vibe two zone combustion model, which is widely used for the mathematical modeling of spark-ignition engines is employed for the numerical analysis of the combustion process. A significant reduction of ~50% in NOx emissions was observed across the engine speed range. However, the port injection of ammonia imposed some negative impacts on engine equivalent BSFC, CO and HC emissions, increasing these parameters by 3%, 30% and 21%, respectively, at the 10% ammonia injection ratio. Additionally, the minimum octane number of primary fuel required to prevent knock was reduced by up to 3.6% by adding ammonia between 5 and 10%. All in all, the injection of ammonia inside a bio-fueled engine could make it robust and produce less NOx, while having some undesirable effects on BSFC, CO and HC emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - 2-Oxoglutarate carboxylase (OGC), a unique member of the biotin-dependent carboxylase family from the order Aquificales, captures dissolved CO2 via the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle. Structure and function studies of OGC may facilitate adaptation of the rTCA cycle to increase the level of carbon fixation for biofuel production. Here we compare the biotin carboxylase (BC) domain of Hydrogenobacter thermophilus OGC with the well-studied mesophilic homologues to identify features that may contribute to thermal stability and activity. We report three OGC BC X-ray structures, each bound to bicarbonate, ADP, or ADP-Mg2+, and propose that substrate binding at high temperatures is facilitated by interactions that stabilize the flexible subdomain B in a partially closed conformation. Kinetic measurements with varying ATP and biotin concentrations distinguish two temperature-dependent steps, consistent with biotin's rate-limiting role in organizing the active site. Transition state thermodynamic values derived from the Eyring equation indicate a larger positive ΔH± and a less negative Δ+ compared to those of a previously reported mesophilic homologue. These thermodynamic values are explained by partially rate limiting product release. Phylogenetic analysis of BC domains suggests that OGC diverged prior to Aquificales evolution. The phylogenetic tree identifies mis-annotations of the Aquificales BC sequences, including the Aquifex aeolicus pyruvate carboxylase structure. Notably, our structural data reveal that the OGC BC dimer comprises a "wet"dimerization interface that is dominated by hydrophilic interactions and structural water molecules common to all BC domains and likely facilitates the conformational changes associated with the catalytic cycle. Mutations in the dimerization domain demonstrate that dimerization contributes to thermal stability. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Triacylglycerol Lipases (TGLs) are the major enzymes involved in triacylglycerol catabolism. TGLs hydrolyze long-chain fatty acid triglycerides, which are involved in plant development and abiotic stress responses. Whereas most studies of TGLs have focused on seed oil metabolism and biofuel in plants, limited information is available regarding the genome-wide identification and characterization of the TGL gene family in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Based on the latest published tomato genome annotation ITAG4.0, 129 SlTGL genes were identified and classified into 5 categories according to their structural characteristics. Most SlTGL genes were distributed on 3 of 12 chromosomes. Segment duplication appeared to be the driving force underlying expansion of the TGL gene family in tomato. The promoter analysis revealed that the promoters of SlTGLs contained many stress responsiveness cis-elements, such as ARE, LTR, MBS, WRE3, and WUN-motifs. Expression of the majority of SlTGL genes was suppressed following exposure to chilling and heat, while it was induced under drought stress, such as SlTGLa9, SlTGLa6, SlTGLa25, SlTGLa26, and SlTGLa13. These results provide valuable insights into the roles of the SlTGL genes family and lay a foundation for further functional studies on the linkage between triacylglycerol catabolism and abiotic stress responses in tomato. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The production of methanol from glycerol over a basic oxide, such as MgO, using high reaction temperatures (320 °C) is a promising new approach to improving atom efficiency in the production of biofuels. The mechanism of this reaction involves the homolytic cleavage of the C3 feedstock, or its dehydration product hydroxyacetone, to produce a hydroxymethyl radical species which can then abstract an H atom from other species. Obtaining a detailed reaction mechanism for this type of chemistry is difficult due to the large number of products present when the system is operated at high conversions. In this contribution we show how DFT based modelling studies can provide new insights into likely reaction pathways, in particular the source of H atoms for the final step of converting hydroxymethyl radicals to methanol. We show that water is unlikely to be important in this stage of the process, C-H bonds of C2 and C3 species can give an energetically favourable pathway and that the disproportionation of hydroxymethyl radicals to methanol and formaldehyde produces a very favourable route. Experimental analysis of reaction products confirms the presence of formaldehyde. The calculations presented in this work also provide new insight into the role of the catalyst surface in the reaction showing that the base sites of the MgO(100) are able to deprotonate hydroxymethyl radicals but not methanol itself. In carrying out the calculations we also show how periodic DFT and QM/MM approaches can be used together to obtain a rounded picture of molecular adsorption to surfaces and homolytic bond cleavage which are both central to the reactions studied.

AB  - A great emphasis is placed on searching for efficient sources to produce renewable fuels due to the actual trends in avoiding the use of fossil resources to mitigate the environment’s deterioration. Thus, the use of waste from the food or wood industry for the production of biofuels is widely researched and may contribute to sustainable general development. Rendered fat and Fischer-Tropsch waxes are high-energy materials which could be used for the pyrolysis reaction. Therefore, in this study, the effect of reaction parameters and feedstock composition on the distribution of the pyrolysis products has been examined. The experiments were carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere in a multi-shot pyrolizer instrument equipped with GC-FID. First, the influence of the temperature was examined at 785, 800, and 815◦C. The highest yield to olefins was observed at 815◦C. The effect of triglycerides and paraffins contents (0–100% with 10% ramp) in the feedstock on the product composition was investigated at 815◦C. The gas chromatography analyses revealed that the feedstock composition did not significantly affect the product composition due to the high temperature and the long linear chain structure similarities between the free fatty acids and Fischer-Tropsch waxes. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - A nickel-based metal-organic framework catalyst was prepared, and the catalytic efficiency for converting the microalgae biomass and its hydrothermal extracted bio-oil through deoxygenation and hydrocracking into jet biofuel was studied. When metal-organic framework was loaded with nickel metal, the content of carbon, oxygen, and cobalt decreased and the nickel content increased to 22.25%. A proportion of electrons of cobalt within metal-organic framework was transferred to the successfully loaded nickel metal. The subcritical hydrothermal extracted bio-oil from microalgae was deoxygenated and hydrocracked over nickel-based metal-organic framework catalyst to obtain jet biofuel products. The conversion rate and selectivity were 90.51% and 37.83%, respectively, which were significantly higher than the jet biofuel products prepared by direct catalytic conversion of microalgae biomass. Palmitic acid, a typical component of microalgae bio-oil, was regarded as a model molecule to reveal the competitive reaction mechanism of deoxygenation and hydrocracking through quantum chemical calculation. When Ni-H was added to the carbon atom within carbonyl group, the bond length between carbonyl carbon atom and adjacent carbon atom was extended from 0.08007 nm to 0.08132 nm, which promoted decarboxylation of palmitic acid. In the meanwhile, the reaction enthalpy for the addition of Ni-H onto the carbon atom within carbonyl group was -40.8 kJ/mol, which was lower than that for the addition of Ni-H onto the oxygen atom within carbonyl group (157.9 kJ/mol), so that Ni-H inclined to add onto the carbon atom in the decarboxylation reaction. © 2021, Science Press.

AB  - Glycerol is a readily available and inexpensive substance that is mostly generated during biofuel production processes. In order to ensure the viability of the biofuel industry, it is essential to develop complementing technologies for the resource utilization of glycerol. Ethylene glycol is a two-carbon organic chemical with multiple applications and a huge market. In this study, an artificial enzymatic cascade comprised alditol oxidase, catalase, glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate reductase, pyruvate decarboxylase and lactaldehyde:propanediol oxidoreductase was developed for the production of ethylene glycol from glycerol. The reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) generated during the dehydrogenation of the glycerol oxidation product D-glycerate can be as the reductant to support the ethylene glycol production. Using this in vitro synthetic system with self-sufficient NADH recycling, 7.64 ± 0.15 mM ethylene glycol was produced from 10 mM glycerol in 10 h, with a high yield of 0.515 ± 0.1 g/g. The in vitro enzymatic cascade is not only a promising alternative for the generation of ethylene glycol but also a successful example of the value-added utilization of glycerol. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Grape pomace can be used to produce several products, such as, biofuels, fertilizers, or catalysts. This work focuses on the carbonization of grape pomace assessing the impact of the carbonization temperature and temperature rate on the properties of the resulting biochars. The potential use of the produced biochars were analyzed by a multiple criteria decision method. To this end, grape pomace particles of 250 μm were carbonized in a nitrogen atmosphere using a horizontal electrically heated tube furnace. The experiments were carried out for temperatures between 300 and 800 °C and residence times between 30 and 75 min. The resulting biochars were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The results reveal that i) the biochar yields decrease from ~51% to ~30% as the carbonization temperature increases from 300 to 800 °C; ii) the biochar produced at higher temperature presents the lowest H/C and O/C ratios; iii) for raw biomass the thermal degradation of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin occurred at temperatures below 600 °C, while for the biochars only cellulose and lignin decomposition happened; iv) the biochars present ashes with high contents of magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and calcium; and v) the biochar obtained at 400 and 500 °C is adequate for biofertilizer and 400 °C for biocatalyst application. For the biofuel application the best temperature was 500 and 600 °C. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates the saccharification rate of Typha orientalis pretreated with Ionic liquids 4-(3-Methyl−1-imidazolio) − 1-butanesulfonic acid hydrogen sulfate [BSO3HMIM] [HSO4], combined with microwave irradiation for liquid biofuel production. Methods of full factorial experimental design was used to explore the factors affecting the conversion rate of fibers into fermentable sugar. The results from Plackett-Burman Design (PBD) shows that efficiency on the saccharification rate of Typha orientalis was in the order of microwave power > solvent volume > catalyst > reaction time. From the results obtained, optimum parameter was determined by Central Composite Design (CCD) where the highest saccharification rate attained was 52.9%. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Sewage sludge is a promising biomass alternative for the production of liquid biofuels. In this study, bio-oil derived from the fast pyrolysis of domestic sewage sludge was upgraded in a micro Robinson–Mahoneyreactor at 4 MPa and 260 °C, and in the presence of hybridized Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst and ethanol. Fourier transform infrared and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses were used to identify the functional groups and chemical components of raw and upgraded sewage sludge bio-oil. Results showed that catalytic upgrading reduced the relative content of acids, aldehydes, phenols, ketones, and nitrogenated compounds in the pyrolytic bio-oil. Thus, the main components of the upgraded bio-oil product included esters (48.59%), alkanes (10.12%), aromatics (9.38%), and alkenes (5.08%). Water and nitriles in the raw pyrolytic bio-oil together with in-situ-produced carbon oxides helped in the esterification of raw bio-oil. Reaction mechanisms such as nitrile hydrolysis, hydrogenation, and esterification were proposed to elucidate the conversion of the non-acidic pyrolytic bio-oil into ester-dominating upgraded bio-oil. Overall, upgrading sewage sludge pyrolytic oil is crucial to produce high-quality diesel-range biofuel. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bamboo is a grass that has gained economic attention in the food industry as a source of dietary fiber, and the young bamboo culm may be an alternative to supply fibers to the market. The objective was to evaluate and characterize different portions (bottom, middle and top) of the young bamboo culm fibrous fractions from Dendrocalamus asper, Bambusa tuldoides and B. vulgaris regarding their color parameters, physicochemical composition and hemicellulosic polysaccharide characterization. Fibrous fractions were obtained after starch extraction and results showed high amounts of total dietary fiber (79–89%). The hemicellulosic polysaccharide contents (35.4–41.5%) demonstrated great potential for commercial extraction and so, we extracted them with alkali and fractionated regarding their solubility in cold-water. Insoluble polysaccharides (KP fractions) were obtained in higher yields (from 21.2% to 38.5%) than the soluble ones (KS fractions, yields from 2.3% to 5.2%). Monosaccharide composition showed mainly xylose and arabinose, with some minor amounts of mannose and galactose in some fractions. In a detailed NMR analysis, the presence of neutral xylans and arabinoxylans could be observed in all studied bamboo species, which can be used in food products and also in the production of xylooligosaccharides (XOS), biomaterials and biofuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Co-hydroprocessing of straight-run gasoil (SRGO) – rapeseed oil (RSO) mixture over stacked bed sulfide catalytic system (Mo/Al2O3 + NiMo/Al2O3-SAPO-11) was investigated at temperature 350–380 °C, pressure 4.0–7.0 MPa, H2/feed – 1000 Nm3/m3 and liquid hour space velocity 1.0–1.5 h−1. Mo/Al2O3 catalyst was used in the first layer to provide selective conversion of RSO preferably through “direct hydrodeoxygenation” route, excluding COx formation. The influence of temperature and pressure on the product quality and on the conversion of n-octadecane (n-C18H38) produced in hydrodeoxygenation of RSO were studied. The co-processing of 30%RSO/70%SRGO mixture at 350 °C, 5.0 MPa, 1000 Nm3/m3 and 1.5 h−1 gives the product with the acceptable density, sulfur and aromatics contents, but increased cloud point (-1°C). It was shown that a temperature increase from 350 °C to 380 °C resulted in a decrease of cloud point for 12° due to higher n-C18H38 conversion at 380 °C. On the contrary, a pressure increase from 4.0 to 7.0 MPa led to a decrease of n-C18H38 conversion over sulfide Mo/Al2O3 + NiMo/Al2O3-SAPO-11 catalysts. This observation could be explained by higher concentration of NH3 and H2S, by-products of SRGO hydrotreatment, in liquid phase at higher pressure. To prove this hypothesis the effects of NH3 and H2S were investigated on co-processing of 30 wt% RSO in hydrotreated SRGO. It was found that the presence of NH3 was the main reason of inhibiting effect on hydrocracking/ hydroisomerization reactions in co-processing of RSO-SRGO mixtures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, valorization of food and lignocellulosic wastes into biodiesel and 2-phenylethanol using Metchinikowia pulcherrima isolated from rotten food wastes was evaluated. At the optimum pH of 5.5, food waste hydrolysate (FWH) showed 74.1% higher dry weight than the corresponding synthetic medium. Rice straw (RS) and softwood sawdust (WWA) were used as additional carbon sources to increase the C:N ratio of FWH. WWA enhanced the biomass production by 23.3% and 55.9% over the corresponding RS and FWH, respectively; while RS enhanced lipid accumulation. Due to enhancement of growth, 75 g WWA showed the maximum recorded lipid productivity of 2.49 g L−1 d−1. Interestingly, both hexoses and pentoses were effectively metabolized. Regarding fatty acid profile of M. pulcherrima, RS- and WWA-enriched growth media showed higher saturated fatty acids proportions (56.9% and 98.3%, respectively, over that of FWH), with better biodiesel characteristics. FWH showed the heights significant production of 2-phenylethanol up to 56.7 mg L−1 after 96 hours. However, FWH enriched with WWA showed the highest gross energy output of 33.98 GJ m−3 y−1. Thus, the present study suggested an integrated approach of M. pulcherrima cultivation on FWH enriched with WWA for efficient biofuel production through waste recycling. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - To improve the production rate of methane, powder-activated carbon (PAC), granule activated carbon (GAC), titanium dioxide-anatase (TiO2), and synthesized zeolite (permutit) were added in the co-digestion process. The co-substrates were corn stover (CS) and pig manure (PM) mixed in the ratio of 1:2 (w/w). The kinetic analysis model and ADM1da model were applied to obtain the kinetic parameters of the process. Besides, the heat flow analysis of the co-digestion process was determined using isothermal microcalorimetry. The addition of the PAC, GAC, TiO2, and synthesized zeolite improved the methane cumulative yield by 40.12, 31.25, 31.17, and 43.74% respectively, as compared with the control reactor. The kinetic analysis and ADM1da model results indicated that the overall rate constant of the co-digestion process increased by 1.5 times averagely because of the effect of these materials. It was also observed that much higher heat energy released from the experimental sample compared with the control reactor, which indicated that the improvement of the metabolic process of the AcoD system. The addition of TiO2-anatase improved methane production by 31.17%, which could be a promising method to improve the biomethane in a large-scale due to its availability and accessibility. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A total 42.68 g/L monosaccharide with 0.10 g/L HMF was obtained from 10% (w/v) Kappaphycus alvarezii with thermal acid hydrolysis using 350 mM HNO3 at 121 °C for 60 min and enzymatic saccharification with a 1:1 mixture of Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5 L for 72 h. To enhance the galactose utilization rate, fermentation was performed with overexpression of GAL1 (galactokinase), GAL7 (galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase), GAL10 (UDP-glucose-4-epimerase), and PGM2 (phosphoglucomutase 2) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK2 using CCW12 as a strong promoter. Among the strains, the overexpression of PGM2 showed twofold high galactose utilization rate (URgal) and produced ethanol 1.4-fold more than that of the control. Transcriptional analysis revealed the increase of PGM2 transcription level leading to enhance glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate and plays a key role in ensuring a higher glycolytic flux in the PGM2 strain. This finding shows particular importance in biofuel production from seaweed because galactose is one of the major monosaccharides in seaweeds such as K. alvarezii. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The feasibility of surfactants for enhancement of extraction efficiencies in wet oil extraction through an acidic hydrothermal process was evaluated. Three different types of surfactants were tested: anionic (SDBS and SDS), cationic (CTAB and MBC), and non-ionic (IGEPAL CA-210 and Tween 60). The total fatty acid content of Chlorella vulgaris was 291.0 mg/g cell. Under the no-surfactant condition, the oil-extraction yield of the acidic hydrothermal extraction was 75.5%. The addition of SDBS and MBC at the 0.4% concentration showed enhanced oil-extraction performance, 85.4 and 85.7% yields, respectively. CTAB and Tween 60 showed low extraction yields, less than 43.0%. SDS and IGEPAL CA-210 showed high oil-extraction yields, higher, in fact, than the initial fatty acid content, due to surfactant partitioning into microalgal oil. With increasing surfactant concentration, the oil-extraction yields of CTAB decreased, those of IGEPAL CA-210 gradually increased, and those of SDBS increased and then decreased again. The best performance, an oil-extraction yield of 95.6%, was observed under the 0.2% SDBS, 120 °C, 1 h condition. Although IGEPAL CA-210 showed the high net oil-extraction yield of 98.3% at the 0.6% surfactant concentration, 61.2% of surfactant was partitioned into oil.

AB  - Abstract: Sugarcane biofuel processing plays an important role in the Brazilian economy, being Brazil the world’s largest sugarcane ethanol producer. Nevertheless, the success of its distilleries depends on how they overcome the new scientific challenges faced, mainly regarding the disposal or reuse of sugarcane vinasse. In this sense, the present work uses Aspen Hysys® to simulate an innovative synthesis gas production process integrated into an ethanol distillery. Initially, the distillery is simulated and validated using industrial real data from a plant located in Brazil in order to analyze the potential of sugarcane vinasse generation. Thereafter, conventional (from natural gas) and renewable (from vinasse-based biomass) routes for syngas production through steam methane reforming are compared considering both, technical feasibility and economic investment. Such comparison presents a more rigorous simulation of the vinasse-based plant and shows that the proposed scenario might be 27.87% less expensive than the plant from natural gas. The production plant of syngas from vinasse-based biogas is evaluated to further improve the thermal efficiency and financial performance of the process designed. The results demonstrate that syngas production coupled to ethanol plants is a promising market to countries ascending in technology development for biomass utilization, such as Brazil.

AB  - This study represented the catalytic pyrolysis of waste cooking oil (WCO) to produce biofuel via continuous reaction by using a pelleted Thai dolomite catalyst. The effect of calcination temperatures on catalyst synthesis was also examined in varying from 600 to 900°C for 2 h. Calcined Thai dolomite (CTD) samples were characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential-thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption apparatus, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). In the catalytic pyrolysis process, the CTD catalysts were taken place in a packed bed pyrolysis reactor under atmospheric pressure for biofuel production in different reaction temperatures (450 to 550°C), and WHSV was about 0.5 h-1. The results were found that the effect of calcination temperature significantly altered the physicochemical properties of catalyst as well as the catalytic performance. The specific surface area and pore volume decreased with increasing the calcination temperatures. Besides, CaCO3 was transformed entirely into CaO at 900°C. For the catalytic pyrolysis process, the results were found that the highest pyrolytic yield was obtained at 500°C of reaction temperature using catalyst calcined at 700°C. Additionally, the results also expressed that the calcined temperature was significant in the quality of biofuel products. Moreover, the biofuel products can be separated into biogasoline, biokerosene, and biodiesel. The kinetic viscosity and heating value were satisfied following the standard values except for the acid value of all biofuel products. However, the acid value decreased when the CDT calcined at the highest temperature due to the obvious presenting of the CaO phase. © 2021, Paulus Editora. All rights reserved.

AB  - Development of artificial enzymes, including nanozymes as an alternative for non-stable and expensive natural enzymes, is a booming field of modern Biosensorics and Biofuel Technology. In this study, we describe fabrication and characterization of sensitive biosensors for the detection of ethanol and glucose based on new micro/nanocomposite electrodes with peroxidase-like activity (nanozyme) coupled with microbial oxidases: alcohol oxidase (AOX) and glucose oxidase (GOX). The nanozyme was synthesized by modification of carbon microfibers (CF) by hemin (H) and gold (Au) nanoparticles. The formation of gold nanoparticles on the surface of hemin-modified carbon microfibers has been confirmed by the UV–Vis and X-ray spectroscopy as well by the SEM analysis. Compared to hemin-only modified electrodes, the resulting micro/nanocomposite CF-H-Au electrodes exhibit a higher specific catalytic activity and a better affinity for H2O2 in solution. The H2O2-sensitive CF-H-Au-modified electrodes showed a higher sensitivity (1.3–2.6-fold) compared with the nearest carbon-derived analogs and were used for the construction of highly sensitive ethanol and glucose biosensors. To eliminate diffusion limitation for substrates, AOX or GOX were fixed on the CF-H-Au-modified electrodes using a highly porous Nafion membrane. The main biosensors’ characteristics have been investigated. The developed biosensors were tested for ethanol and glucose analysis in the real samples of both grape must and wine. The results are in good agreement with the results obtained using enzymatic kits as reference approaches. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An indirect fuel cell concept is presented herein, where a palladium-based membrane (either pure Pd with 25 μm thickness or Pd75Ag25 alloy with 10 μm thickness) is used to separate the electrochemical cell compartment from a catalysis compartment. In this system, hydrogen is generated from a hydrogen-rich molecule, such as formic acid, and selectively permeated through the membrane into the electrochemical compartment where it is then converted into electricity. In this way, hydrogen is generated and converted in situ, overcoming the issues associated with hydrogen storage and presenting chemical hydrogen storage as an attractive and feasible alternative with potential application in future micro- and macro-power devices for a wide range of applications and fuels. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - In this research, Ni-based catalysts with different supports (HBeta and HZSM-5) were prepared via the impregnation method and subsequently tested for the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of crude pyrolysis oil (CPO) using supercritical methanol (MeOH). The Ni/HBeta showed a better catalytic performance than Ni/HZSM-5, resulting in a 43.81% deoxygenation degree of CPO. In addition, the ether extraction of CPO was carried out to remove its heavy fraction and improve the efficiency of the upgrading process. A high-quality refined oil was achieved after using the combined physicochemical treatments of ether extraction and supercritical catalytic HDO. The upgrading efficiency was evaluated in terms of the degree of deoxygenation, carbon residue value, water content, higher heating value, and distribution of products. The effect of the type of supercritical solvent on the catalytic HDO performance of Ni/HZSM-5 was evaluated by replacing MeOH with ethanol (EtOH). The results showed that when MeOH was substituted with EtOH, the yields of the gaseous and solid products were significantly reduced, while the yield of liquid products was considerably increased. Meanwhile, the content of coke deposited on the catalysts was analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis, and the coke compositions were evaluated using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. While the minimum catalytic coke content was obtained using Ni/HBeta in the supercritical HDO of CPO, the minimum coke content was observed using Ni/HZSM-5 in the upgrading of ether-extracted pyrolysis oil (EEPO). The FTIR results revealed that the coke deposited on the catalysts was mainly formed through condensation, rearrangement, and hydrogen transfer mechanisms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although multicopper oxidase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum (McoP) can be particularly useful in biotechnological applications, e.g., as a specific catalyst at the biocathode of biofuel cells (BFCs), owing to its high stability against extremely high temperatures and across a wide range of pH values, this application potential remains limited due to the enzyme's low catalytic activity. A directed evolution strategy was conducted to improve McoP catalytic activity, and the No. 571 mutant containing four amino acid substitutions was identified, with specific activity approximately 9-fold higher than that of the wild type enzyme. Among the substitutions, the single amino acid mutant F290I was essential in enhancing catalytic activity, with a specific activity approximately 12-fold higher than that of the wild type enzyme. F290I thermostability and pH stability were notably comparable with values obtained for the wild type. Crystal structure analysis suggested that the F290I mutant increased loop flexibility near the T1 Cu center, and affected electron transfer between the enzyme and substrate. Additionally, electric current density of the F290I mutant-immobilized electrode was 7-fold higher than that of the wild type-immobilized one. These results indicated that F290I mutant was a superior catalyst with potential in practical biotechnological applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The introduction of biodiesel to the energy production of Brazil occurred mainly because of a legislative incentive that delimits minimum contents of this biofuel to be added to conventional diesel in the whole country. Despite the growth prospects for this sector, there are several difficulties related to the use of biodiesel in combustion engines. Hydroprocessed diesel or green diesel is a viable alternative of renewable biofuel to complement the conventional diesel production; it presents several technical and economic advantages over the biodiesel produced through the transesterification process. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to gather technical information about green diesel, compare it to biodiesel, and analyze the potential of introducing this biofuel to the energy production in Brazil as a substitute or a complementary alternative to conventional diesel. Green diesel stands out technically, mainly when produced from residual raw materials. Considering green diesel production only from fatty waste, it is estimated to serve approximately 55% of the biodiesel demand in Brazil, today produced mostly from crude soybean oil. In addition, the production of this biofuel may occur in existing plants of oil processing through minor adaptations, which ensures reduced installation costs, production, and logistics, especially when considering the current installed capacity in the country. The biggest deadlock related to large-scale production of green diesel in oil refineries in Brazil is the lack of specific legislation that regulates and defines parameters and conditions for the marketing of biofuel. ©

AB  - The development of new bio-based diesel substitutes can improve their compatibility with diesel engines. Nevertheless, for actual implementation, their environmental and economic performance needs to be studied. This study quantified the eco-efficiency of three bio-based diesels, viz., fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), partially hydrogenated FAME (H-FAME), and bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD), to address the perspective of producers as well as policymakers for implementing the advanced diesel alternatives. The eco-efficiency was assessed as a ratio of life cycle costing as the economic indicator and three different environmental damages—human health, ecosystem quality, and resource availability. The eco-efficiency of FAME was the most favorable among all the potential substitutes with regard to human health and ecosystem quality, but the least favorable for resource availability impact. Even though BHD was beneficial in terms of life cycle costing, it was the least preferable when considering human health and ecosystem quality, though it performed the best for resource availability. H-FAME was also promising, in line with FAME. It is suggested that the technologies for BHD production should be improved, especially the catalyst used, which contributed greatly to environmental impacts and costs. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Micro-reactor (MR) technology is known as an alternative technique for producing materials in a more sustainable way. The advantages of micro-reactors and membrane separation which are combined in membrane micro-reactors (MMR) listed as improved heat and mass transfer, high surface area to volume ratio, enhanced catalytic efficiency with no equilibrium limitation, flexibility in reactor design, a short distance of molecular diffusion as well as high operational safety. The restriction of low production capacity of micro-reactors can be easily solved by using parallel micro-channels in a reactor chip. This mini-review represents firstly the definition of micro-reactors as well as the advantages and disadvantages of membrane micro-reactors. Furthermore, the theoretical basics of membrane micro-reactors and their fabrication methods are presented. At last, the application of catalytic membrane micro-reactors in different processes is given especially in biofuel production. The achieved results of previous researches for hydrogen and other fuels production show better performance of catalytic MMRs in terms of reaction conversion and coke deposition compared with convectional reactors at the same reaction conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, natural source Parangtritis beach sand was extracted into mesoporous silica (MS). Synthesis of mesoporous silica (MS) was carried out at sodium silicate: CTAB ratio of 1:0.5 (w/w). Monometallic catalyst was used to improve the performance of the catalyst. The monometallic used was Mo metal, which was synthesized using the wet impregnation method. Catalysts were characterized using FTIR, XRD, Surface Area Analyzer (SAA), SEM–EDX, and TEM. MS has pore diameters and surface area of 2.62 nm and 897.3 m2/g, respectively. Mo/MS has pore diameters, surface area, and Mo metal concentration of 2.46 nm, 593 m2/g, and 4.75%, respectively. Catalytic activity and selectivity were evaluated in hydrocracking of waste palm cooking oil at 500, 550, and 600 °C, and catalyst: waste palm cooking oil ratio of 1:100, 1:200, and 1:300. The best catalyst will be tested for reusability 3 times through the hydrocracking process. Mo/MS produces better liquid products and hydrocarbon compounds than MS. The results of the conversion of liquid products analyzed using GCMS. The yield of liquid products obtained in the hydrocracking of waste palm cooking oil using Mo/MS with the optimum temperature and the weight ratio of catalyst: feed at 550 °C and 1: 300 was 66.99 wt.% with consists of hydrocarbon compound as 62.79 wt.%. The yield of liquid products obtained in the hydrocracking waste palm cooking oil using the used Mo/MS catalyst in the last run was 80.26 wt.% with consist of hydrocarbon compound as 74.13 wt.%.

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass, is an important platform molecule that can be used to produce valuable biofuels and polymeric materials. Electrochemical reduction of HMF is of great interest as it uses water as the hydrogen source and achieves desired reduction reactions at room temperature and ambient pressure. Hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis are two important reactions for reductive HMF conversion. Therefore, elucidating key characteristics of electrocatalysts that govern the selectivity for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis is critical in rationally developing efficient and selective electrocatalysts. In this study, combined experimental and computational investigations are used to demonstrate how the adsorption energy of HMF on metal surfaces and the resulting changes in the intramolecular bond lengths of adsorbed HMF directly impact the reduction pathways of HMF. These results make it possible to rationally understand a general trend in the behaviors observed when using various metal electrodes for HMF reduction. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) can convert methoxyphenols in lignin-derived bio-oil to phenols, a precursor of biofuels. In this work, Mo2C/C catalysts were prepared with lignin-derived biochar as a carbon source for the HDO reaction of guaiacol. The carburization degree of catalyst precursors was tuned by varying the carburization temperature and activation method, thus affecting the activity of the catalyst. Higher carburization temperatures promoted the formation of active Mo2C species at the expense of inactive MoOx and MoSx species. In addition to the high carburization temperature (800 °C), biochar also needed to be activated by H3PO4, HNO3, or a two-step process to obtain Mo2C species. The use of hydrocarbon solvents could reduce the competitive adsorption of the solvent over reactants while inhibiting the side reactions involving solvents, such as alkylation and etherification. Optimized 12.5Mo2C/C-H3PO4 (800) offered a high guaiacol conversion of 98.7% and a phenol yield of 66.8% under the optimum conditions. The yield of methanol was as high as 39.5%, indicating that the demethoxylation reaction was dominant. The catalytic system also exhibited high activity for the HDO of other lignin-derived methoxyphenols to produce phenols. ©

AB  - Developing an efficient and selective catalyst for C-O hydrogenolysis of biomass-derived aromatic aldehydes, such as 5-methylfurfural (MF), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and vanillin (VA), is highly significant for the synthesis of biofuel and fine chemicals. Herein, metal-organic framework (MOF)-encapsulating metal-acid interfaces (Pd@UiO-CH2SO3H, Pd@UiO-PhSO3H) were first reported. Compared with traditionally supported catalysts (Pd/UiO-SO3H, Pd/UiO-NH2), Pd-acid-interface-encapsulated MOFs show much higher activity and selectivity for MF to 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), HMF to DMF, and VA to 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP) reactions. In particular, Pd@UiO-SO3H shows the best catalytic performance with 89.0 and 86.0% DMF yield from MF and HMF and a 99.4% MMP yield from VA based on its suitable hydrophilicity, high hydrogen activation ability, and abundant Pd-SO3H interface active sites. According to the catalytic performance of Pd/UiO-NH2 and the results of an ATR-IR test, the acidic sites on the Pd-acid interface can accelerate the activation of the hydroxyl group for these hydrogenolysis reactions. This work provides an effective design strategy for the preparation of MOF-encapsulating metal-acid interfaces and shows the powerful synergistic effect of hydrogenation and acid catalysis. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We report a variety of rhenium complexes supported by bidentate and tridentate phosphinoamine ligands and their use in the formation of the advanced biofuel isobutanol from methanol and ethanol. Rhenium pincer complexes 1-3 are effective catalysts for this process, with 2 giving isobutanol in 35% yields, with 97% selectivity in the liquid fraction, over 16 h with catalyst loadings as low as 0.07 mol %. However, these catalysts show poorer overall selectivity, with the formation of a significant amount of carboxylate salt solid byproduct also being observed. Production of the active catalyst 1d has been followed by 31P NMR spectroscopy, and the importance of the presence of base and elevated temperatures to catalyst activation has been established. Complexes supported by diphosphine ligands are inactive for Guerbet chemistry; however, complexes supported by bidentate phosphinoamine ligands show greater selectivity for isobutanol formation over carboxylate salts. The novel complex 7 was able to produce isobutanol in 28% yield over 17 h. The importance of the N-H moiety to the catalytic performance has also been established, giving further weight to the hypothesis that these catalysts operate via a cooperative mechanism. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The need for sustainable wastewater treatment and search for cheap feedstock for renewable energy production have driven investigators to evaluate the potential of producing biofuels from waste materials such as sewage sludge. The current work is aimed at assessing the potential for producing hydrocarbons from the lipid fraction of activated sludge via a catalytic hydrothermal decarboxylation reaction under varying residence time. Impacts of platinum on carbon (Pt/C) and palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalysts were evaluated at 290 °C and residence time of 0.5, 1, 3 and 4 h. The analyses of the lipids and hydrocarbons were done using high-temperature gas chromatography. The results show that at the optimum conditions of 1 h, 290 °C, 20 mg of catalyst, 100 mg of lipid extract and 15 mL of water, the maximum yield of hydrocarbon was 23.2% of pentadecane obtained using Pt/C. This shows that the dominant hydrocarbon is pentadecane and that Pt/C exhibited greater catalytic effect than did Pd/C. The hydrocarbons might be used directly as renewable diesel and as such will contribute to the mitigation of climate change since emission of greenhouse gases will be reduced, and the use of activated sludge as the feedstock is expected to help minimize the cost of production and to ensure sustainable wastewater treatment. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The electrocatalytic methanol conversion is of importance in direct methanol fuel cell, biomass reforming, and hydrogen generation. To achieve a “carbon-neutral” target, CO2 byproducts derived from biofuels should be mitigated. In contrast to the complete oxidation of methanol to CO2, the selective oxidation of methanol to formate is a CO2-emission-free route without the generation of toxic CO intermediates. Herein, we present a highly active catalyst based on transition-metal disulfide nanosheet arrays supported on Ni foam for methanol conversion. Through composition screening, we find that the FeCoNi disulfide nanosheet exhibits a highly efficient and selective methanol-to-formate conversion. The surface reconstruction of this catalyst allows us to produce 0.66 mmol cm−2 h−1 of formate at low potential (1.40 V) with high faradaic efficiency of &gt; 98%. This work offers a substantial composition tuning strategy to construct noble-metal-free active multi-metal sites for CO2-emission-free conversion of methanol to value-added formate. © 2021

AB  - Herein, we successfully construct the 3D biocompatible graphene through crosslinking 2D graphene nanosheet onto carbon fiber paper with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) as anode of the alcohol biofuel cell. Compared with the bioanode without 3D graphene, the current density and output power of PDDA-graphene-ADH bioanode is increased by 23 % and 41 % at a high concentration of ethanol at pH 8.9, suggesting the stabilization role of graphene in enzyme loading. The study provides us a deep analysis on structures and performances of the bioanode incl. electrochemistry, X-ray photoelectron spectra, and atomic force microscopy images, which is significant to develop the new methods to construct 3D porous electrodes in energy conversion device. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Hollow cobalt nitrogen-doped carbon (H-CoNC) is suggested for use in the membraneless hydrogen peroxide fuel cell (HPFC) and enzymatic biofuel cell (EBC) as anodic catalyst boosting hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction (HPOR). For fabricating H-CoNCs, a facile spray pyrolysis-assisted process is used, and such produced H-CoNCs show a porous and hollow-shell structure, while they include a large amount of isolated Co atoms and coordinate bonds with Co and nitrogen (Co-N4). This structure promotes mass transfer to the active site and excellent catalytic activity for HPOR. With these benefits of H-CoNCs, the current density of the bioanode consisting of H-CoNC, carbon nanotube, and glucose oxidase (H-CoNC/CNT/GOx) observed at 0.3 V under 150 mM glucose is 315.5 μA cm−2, which is 2.1 times higher than that of a conventionally synthesized catalyst using Co-doped carbon nanoparticles (CoNC-NPs) (CoNC-NPs/CNT/GOx, 146.2 μA cm−2). With this superior catalytic activity for HPOR, maximum power density (MPD) of membraneless EBC using H-CoNC/CNT/GOx is 33.8 ± 4.52 μW cm−2, which is 52% higher than that of CoNP-NPs/CNT/GOx. In addition, a membraneless HPFC using H-CoNC/CNT demonstrates 4.87 times higher MPD (231.3 ± 11.3 μW cm−2) than that using CoNC-NPs/CNT, proving that H-CoNC improves the performance of fuel cells by its excellent catalytic activity. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Corn stover is the abundant biowaste that can be utilized to produce biofuels and high value-added biological products. However, the complex structures of lignocellulose, on the other hand, are highly resistant to subsequent transformations. To promote enzymatic saccharification of corn stover, green and safe phosphotungstic acid was used to pretreat corn stover. Using a single-factor experiment and response surface approach, the influence of different pretreatment variables such as temperature, phosphotungstic acid concentration, pretreatment time, and solid-to-liquid ratio on the pretreatment effect was investigated. The best conditions were 126 ℃, 1.33%, 45 min, and 1:14, respectively, and the cellulose conversion rate was the greatest at 70.61% combined phosphotungstic acid and cellulase, raised by 171.99% when compared to the raw corn stover. Phosphotungstic acid was demonstrated to degrade both hemicellulose and lignin, yielding 25.89 mmol/L xylose. Phosphotungstic acid pretreatment samples were found to be more porous, with cellulase adsorption capacity increased from 161.56 to 245.70 mg/g biomass. CrI/cellulose was found to decrease from 1.09 to 0.77, indicating significant chemical alterations in corn stover functional linkages. These findings suggest that phosphotungstic acid enhances saccharification by altering the structure and chemistry of corn stover. The combination of phosphotungstic acid and cellulase will give an efficient approach for increasing the saccharification of cellulose. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Due to environmental concerns and cost issues, coal is currently being phased out from usage in electricity production. Regardless, there remains a massive stockpile of coal reserves along with a large industrial complex and a robust distribution/processing infrastructure. As such, coal should be considered for usage in other energy areas. Since coal is simply a solid hydrocarbon, it can be converted over for usage as a transportation fuel. The Fischer-Tropsch process that underlies this conversion is well established with some countries like South Africa currently using it at large scales. Unfortunately, this conversion process has a large carbon footprint, even when using carbon capture technology. However, the blending of coal-based fuels with biodiesel has been found to be more carbon neutral than standard diesel or biodiesel alone. Additionally, coal can be used as an alternate to methane for hydrogen production. Given carbon capture technologies and the existing coal infrastructure, these two uses of coal provide opportunities for a sustainable and economical use of coal as a transportation fuel. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The bagasse products generated after the extraction process have significant use in several industrial sectors however its application in the energy sector stands out, avoiding the use of fossil fuels. In this study an enzymatic process was applied through the Pleurotus sajor-caju fungus, for decomposition of the lignin present in the sugarcane bagasse, with the objective of improving the kinetic and bioenergetic parameters of this biomass. Detailed analyzes were carried out, such as kinetic, morphological, elementary and calorific, to verify its quality as biofuel. Values of Ea =31 kJ/mol to 65 kJ/mol, A = 1.4 105 s −1 to 3.0 105 s −1, ΔH = 26 kJ/mol to 60 kJ/mol, ΔG = 124 kJ/mol to 154 kJ/mol and ΔS = 150 J/mol to 157 J/mol for the conversion range (α) from 0.20 to 0.95, were obtained, with little variability in thermo-kinetic parameters. The HHV and fixed carbon values were 19.37 MJ/kg and 83.1%, respectively, demonstrating that this sugar cane residue has the potential to be used as a solid biofuel, after its use in the production of Pleurotus sajor-caju fungi, thus allowing to create more economic value in the sugar cane transformation chain. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - SiO2-Al2O3-supported Ru, Ir and Pt-based catalysts with moderate metal loading (1 %) were tested for the first time in the production of pentyl valerate (PV) in liquid phase from γ-valerolactone, pentanol (in excess) and H2. The acidity of these bifunctional catalysts, plays a key role in the one-pot process comprising two consecutive acid-catalyzed reactions and a metal-catalyzed one. Metal dispersion also shown to be relevant for the conversion of the pentyl pentenoate intermediate into PV by hydrogenation over the metal sites. Pt/SA catalyst with the highest surface acidity and metal dispersion reached optimal GVL conversion with a PV yield of 90.0 % after 10 h, exhibiting a PV productivity of 300 mmol/gM.h, i. e. a value between three and four times higher than the best result reported until now (91.8 mmol/gM.h). These findings highlight the potential that noble metal-based catalyst with moderate metal loading have in the valorization of biomass-derived platform molecules such as γ-valerolactone. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Membraneless microfluidic enzymatic biofuel cells (μEBFCs) operated under the co-laminar flow of fuel and oxidant often face cross-mixing issues, especially at low flow rates. In this work, we propose a new approach to design the single-stream μEBFC based on the investigation of relative positions of the electrodes at the top and bottom of the microchannel. To achieve this, a μEBFC was fabricated with multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes via a stencil method. The bioanode and biocathode were modified with glucose dehydrogenase and laccase via direct covalent bonding, respectively. The best results were attained by placing the cathode at the top and anode at the bottom of the microchannel in a Y-shaped two streamflow μEBFC. When a single electrolyte stream was used to achieve more practicality and ease of use, the performance was reduced by 40%. However, with the new design of electrodes in single-stream μEBFC, i.e. cathode at the top and anode at the bottom facing each other in the microchannel, the performance was recovered by 20%. This corresponds to maximum current and power density of 216 ± 12 μA cm−2 and 69.2 ± 9.2 μW cm−2, respectively. The stacking ability of the device was realized by connecting the two cells in series and parallel. The maximum power density delivered by the two single-stream μEBFCs’ stack reached 160 μW cm−2 at 0.3 V. Thus, this study validates the viability of using single-stream μEBFCs in large stacks to power microelectronics more simply and practically. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The present work investigated the techno-economic feasibility of using gasification as an alternative to direct combustion to generate steam and electric power generation in a sugarcane mill using different types of solid biofuels. Two cogeneration scenarios were analyzed: scenario 1 (S1), using a boiler and steam turbines only, while scenario 2 (S2) uses gas and steam turbines. It was found that for a solid biofuel cost of 8 US $/ton, the economic results between types of biomass are similar, but at a higher solid biofuel cost, the cost of energy production is lower in S2 when compared to S1. The cost of generated power in S1 using sugarcane bagasse (0.091 US $/kWh) is higher than the cost considered for grid electricity (0.077 US$/kWh), while in S2 is lower (0.063 US$/kWh); therefore, electricity might be exported to the grid at a competitive price in S2. In both scenarios, the greatest contribution to the total annual costs comes from the investment required by about 83%. In the case of the other biofuels, such as cladodes, oil brunches, and coffee pulp, the cost obtained is less than 0.077 US$/kWh for all cases in both scenarios, except for the tender cladodes in S1, mainly due to its higher moisture content. The systems studied in S2 using oil palm empty brunches as complementary solid biofuel in the sugar mill are recommended for year-round bioenergy production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The number of immobilized glucose oxidase (GOx) molecules is considerably increased by the structural modification of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and the performance of enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) is positively affected by the modification process. To do this, new rGO with three-dimensional open porous structure is formed by spray freeze drying method (sprGO), while tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) as mediator, and GOx are sequentially immobilized onto sprGO. To improve the loading amount of catalyst, rGO structure is modified to open porous sprGO structure possessing numerous anchoring sites, after which gelatin film crosslinked by glutaraldehyde is fabricated onto sprGO to prevent any losses of other components (sprGO/[TTF-GOx]/crosslinked-gelatin). Specific surface area and charge transfer resistance of sprGO are quantitatively measured, and the actual amount of immobilized GOx and the performance of EBFC using this catalyst are electrochemically examined. With this, it is found that the amount of GOx immobilized in sprGO/[TTF-GOx]/crosslinked-gelatin is twice better that in rGO/[TTF-GOx]/crosslinked-gelatin. More specifically, EBFC using this catalyst shows open circuit voltage of 0.85 V and maximum power density of 380 μW/cm2, and this is 1.4 times better than that using rGO/[TTF-GOx]/crosslinked-gelatin. These results indicate that the amount of immobilized GOx strongly affects the performance capabilities of EBFCs. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

A maximum 19.1 wt% bio-oil yield with HHV of 38.5 MJ/kg was obtained from wet spent coffee grounds. Subsequently, the bio-oil synthesized via hydrothermal liquefaction was upgraded biocatalytically to bring down the acid value and to convert the bio-oil into a higher quality liquid biofuel. During this process the fatty acids present in the bio-oil were converted into fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) using lipase. Novozyme-435 converted ∼ 85% of fatty acids in the bio-oil into fatty acid methyl esters at 35 °C after 14 h, as determined by 1H NMR. In addition, FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of fatty acid esters in the product. The acid number of the bio-oil decreased significantly after the enzymatic reaction. The results shows that lipase is an effective biocatalyst for crude bio-oil upgradation. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Processed oil (HTO) is paraffin-based biofuels derived from many edibles and non-edible sources. HTVO shall be employed in engines as blended fuel with diesel or as neat fuel without or with any major modifications. However, the production of edible resources competes with food production. Hence, alternative non-edible and waste oil will be in high demand over the upcoming years to felicitate the significant replacement of fossil fuels. In this study, catalytic processing of non-edible and waste seed oil derived from custard seeds (HTCSO) was employed to produce fuels as a substitute for the transesterification process. The application of processed treatment will significantly increase in the transport sector in the coming years. This study investigates the extensive study on HTCSO on engine performance and emission patterns of a 4-stroke (Kirloskar AV1), 5.5 kW diesel engine. Ignition patterns were computed at different conditions by altering HTCSO percentage (25 and 50% volume) compared with diesel. Twenty-five and 50% volume of HTCSO blended with 75 and 50% of petrodiesel is referred to as HTCSO25D75 and HTCSO50D50, respectively. HTCSO/diesel blends show that the thermal brake efficiency (BTE), in general, was found to be increased, and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreased with increased volume fraction of HTCSO in the blends. NOx CO, HC, and smoke opacity were found lower for all HTCSO blends than diesel at all load conditions. It shall be decided from the experimental research that HTCSO is a potential alternative to diesel fuel. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study investigated experimentally pyrolysis of rubberwood sawdust (RWS), sewage sludge (SS), and their blends (25:75, 50:50, and 75:25 by weight) in an agitated bed pyrolysis reactor. The yields and characteristics of liquid product and biochar were determined for pyrolysis at 450, 500, and 550 °C and were affected both by temperature and feedstock type. The liquid and biochar yields were in the ranges 27.30–52.42 and 21.43–49.66 (wt%). Pyrolysis of RWS at 550 °C provided the highest liquid yield, while SS gave a high biochar yield. Co-pyrolysis of SS with RWS improved yield and quality of liquid and biochar products. The liquid product had 57.54–70.70 wt% of water and a low hydrocarbon content. The higher heating value (HHV) of water-free liquid product was 14.73–22.45 MJ/kg. The major compounds of liquid product included acetic acid, 2-propanone, 1-hydroxy, and phenols according to GC-MS. The biochar from RWS had a high carbon content (83.37 wt%) and a high HHV (33.57 MJ/kg), while SS biochar was mainly ash (67.62 wt%) with low carbon content. The SS biochar also had high contents of Si, Ca, Fe, K, and Mg as determined by XRF. Co-pyrolysis of SS with RWS improved the biochar by increasing its carbon content and reducing ash and inorganic elements. The surface of RWS biochar was more porous, while SS biochar had the larger specific surface according to SEM and BET. Based on these results, co-pyrolysis of 75:25 feedstock mix is recommended for further studies on applications of liquid product and biochar. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Dual fueling is a successful model in the engine combustion area which perks up the performance and emission fronts. The combined effect of using biodiesel and gas dual fueling shall address the problem associated with emissions and depletion of fossil fuels. Fuel derived from Annona squamosa seeds is a creditable biofuel, which is resulted from waste seeds. This paper characterizes the gaseous exhaust emission and performance model of a dual-fueled, direct injection diesel engine fueled with ethane as gaseous fuel and Annona squamosa biodiesel as the base and liquid fuel. Ethane is supplied with air in the intake manifold at different flow rates (five lpm and ten lpm). Ethane supply at ten lpm lowered HC emissions by seven ppm, CO by 0.4% and smoke emission by 0.2 BSU for biodiesel. In addition, ethane supply to biodiesel lowered the BSFC by 13 kg/kW-h and enhanced the efficiency by 0.4%. Hence, dual-fueling ethane is an effective technique for improving the usage of biofuels in diesel engine applications. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - n-Butanol is used in a wide range of applications and recently, the use of n-butanol as a fuel, which can be employed pure or blended with gasoline or diesel, has been proposed. So, in an attempt to deepen in the one-step catalytic process to produce n-butanol from ethanol, bifunctional catalysts in different chemical/spatial environment as MgAl- and CaFeMg-multioxide catalysts were developed, prepared and characterized. Both mixed oxides were obtained by thermal decomposition of the synthesized hydrotalcites considering the partial substitution of Mg2+ and Al3+ by Ca2+ and Fe3+, namely MgAl-Ox and Ca20Fe20MgAl-Ox. The nature of acid and basic properties of the samples were analyzed employing NH3 and CO2 as probe molecules, and TPD analysis were performed to quantify the relative contribution of acidic/basic sites. Ca20Fe20MgAl-Ox sample presented an improved basicity with minimal acidity reduction. The performances of the activated catalysts were measured in a fixed-bed reactor under transient and continuous operation modes by DRIFT-MS studies and under transient pulse experiments. It was verified that both catalysts, but specially Ca20Fe20MgAl-Ox, promote the synthesis of C4-compounds from ethanol due to the modulated acid and basic sites capable of modify the ethanol adsorption in the form of ethoxy-species and a combined higher basicity with centers to catalyze the hydrogenation using the ethanol as the hydrogen donor. Ca20Fe20MgAl-Ox reached ethanol conversion values of 36% at 280 °C and 71% at 400 °C with a higher selectivity to n-butanol and other C4-compounds. Two parallel routes at differentiated temperatures: direct acetaldehyde self-condensation and the intermediary crotyl alcohol transfer hydrogenation, were evidenced and prevailing in n-butanol formation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rice straw is an important feedstock for second-generation biorefineries, the majority being conventional white rice. This research investigated the potential of the straw of black rice Chakhao Poireiton, a rice variety of increasing importance, for biorefining. Pre-treatment of black rice straw was carried out in a pressurised microwave reactor and free sugar release was measured following digestion with Cellic® CTec3. This was compared to white rice straw. Pre-treatment (100 − 200° C for 5 min) did not drastically impact the sugar composition but brought about an enhanced release of glucose after enzymatic hydrolysis from 25 to 50% (black rice) and from 26 to 55% (white rice). For xylose digestibility, the increase was around seven-fold for black rice (8 to 57%) and five-fold for white rice (13 to 64%). This improvement in digestibility of the straw samples could have come from modification in the lignocellulose structural features making the polysaccharides more susceptible to hydrolysis. Black rice could be a suitable feedstock for a combined biorefinery–food and nutraceuticals from grain (much higher than white rice) and the straw for fermentable sugars comparable to white rice straw for biofuels. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Concerning the climate crisis, energy disaster, and greenhouse effects, microalgae have paved the way for consideration as a biofuel feed material. The advent of polymeric materials with unique architecture at nanoscale, in combination with microalgae, has given direction for the bioeconomic yield of highly valued compounds, essentially lipid. Herein, we discuss the paramount significance of exotic hydrogel matrix (HM) with efficient violet light absorption, far-red emission, CO2-adsorbing capability and catalyst-free condition that could increase the photosynthesis activity, alleviating the microalgal growth for the effective augmentation of lipid, protein, and chlorophyll. The intrinsic morphological and structural features of HM were revealed by a suite of characterizations that confirm its hollow tubular architecture. Fluorescence intensity measurement confirmed the electron transfer from HM to Chlorella sorokiniana, accelerating the photosynthetic rate for the improved production of lipids (98%), proteins (60%), and chlorophyll a (121%), compared to untreated C. sorokiniana control cells. Moreover, by visualizing the Nile red (NR) fluorescence response from C. sorokiniana/HM cells, a high lipid content was observed with a larger cell size (14.6 μm) compared to control cells (8.7 μm). Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), obtained from C. sorokiniana/HM, were noted with a large-scale volume of C16:C18 fatty acids (>80%). We, therefore, envisage that HM plays a significant role in enhancing the generation of lipids and proteins from C. sorokiniana. These outcomes assure a qualitative transit in the bioenergy domain. ©

AB  - The selective hydrogenolysis of C–O bond in furfural and its derivatives provides a sustainable route for transforming biomass-derived feedstocks into valued chemicals. Currently, the development of efficient catalysts which can effectively cleavage C–O bond under mild conditions remains a critical challenge. The present work reports Pt catalysts supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) which are active in 2-methylfuran (2-MF) hydrogenolysis to form pentanols in liquid phase under mild conditions. The impact of various catalyst supports, active metals and reaction conditions in terms of metal loadings, solvent, time, pressure, etc., were explored. The 5 wt% Pt/MWNT catalyst demonstrated an excellent activity and selectivity with 100% 2-MF conversion and 53% pentanols (POLs) yield under 1 MPa H2 at an exceptional low temperature of 25 °C. The reaction mechanism was studied combing both the reactivity tests and characterization results, and it is found that the better catalytic performances of Pt/MWNT were correlated closely to the size of Pt nanoparticles and their interactions with the underlying MWNT support. Accordingly, a reaction pathway involving the adsorption of 2-MF parallel to the Pt nanoparticles and its subsequently selective C–O hydrogenolysis was proposed. This work showcases a promising catalyst for room-temperature biofuel production. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2021, Youke Publishing Co.,Ltd.

AB  - Jatropha curcas and microalga Chlorella pyrenoidosa, two different biofuel feedstocks, are investigated in the present study for optimization of lipid production in the presence of zirconium tetrachloride (ZrCl4) as a novel quenching agent. Furthermore, the biofixation ability of C. pyrenoidosa for carbon dioxide was also determined in batch experimental studies. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied for optimization of bio-oil extraction from selected feedstocks by varying the dose of the quenching agent (mg/g), extraction time (h), and temperature (°C). The optimized yield of bio-oil was obtained with 1.41 mg/g quenching agent, 60 °C temperature, and 1.5 h of reaction time. For J. curcas, optimized yield of bio-oil was 43.78% while 32.45% bio-oil yield was obtained with C. pyrenoidosa. Microalga showed highest biomass productivity (289.34 g L−1 day−1) at 10% CO2 concentration while maximum CO2 sequestration (5.5 ± 0.07 g CO2 L−1 day−1) was observed at 20% CO2 concentrations. Bio-oil obtained from both feedstocks was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), which clearly shows peak at 1400–1700 cm−1 that confirms the presence of carbonyl group (-COOR-). Thus, the present study provides a competitive analysis for the extraction of bio-oil which is an urgent need to enhance the process for economic sustainability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The main focus of this study was to exploit commercial alumina-supported catalysts for the efficient conversion of lignocellulosic-derived furfural (model compound) to value-added biofuels and chemicals. In this regard, a wide range of the catalysts including noble and non-noble metals were investigated. In a fixed-bed microreactor, vapor phase catalytic conversions were conducted in the presence of hydrogen at 225 °C and ambient pressure. In terms of reaction pathways and final product, various characteristics was observed from different catalysts, among which CoMo/Al2O3 had the highest conformity in terms of 100% selectivity toward formation of 2-methyl furan (2-MF) as the final preferred product. The decision-making criteria for catalysts’ capability were not only their conversion ability but also the reaction path. Accordingly, although the catalysts (PdAg, Ni (1), Pt and RePt (1)) showed relatively higher conversions, the reaction path demonstrated sharp affinity to decarbonylation route. In contrast, the catalysts containing Co and Mo demonstrated the best performance for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of furfural to 2-MF without any side reactions. Of course, different combinations of Co and Mo ratio had a decisive role in the conversion and selectivity; while selectivity was 100% with conversion of 27.8% for CoMo (2) (3.4 wt% Co and 13.6 wt% Mo), the selectivity of 79.5% and conversion of 47.1% were for CoMo (1) (4.4 wt% Co and 7.5 wt% Mo). Finally, it seems that through optimization, it is possible to choose the appropriate catalyst from the existing and conventional ones, which depends on our goal of conversion.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biofuels are the most promising sustainable fuels for supplementing shrinking fossil resources. In this work, acid-modified vermiculite (AVM)-supported Pd–Ni bimetallic catalyst (Pd–Ni/AVM) was investigated for the hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil and its model compounds to assess its reactivity. Pd–Ni/AVM was found to efficiently hydrodeoxygenate the investigated model compound (phenol). The phenol conversion reached 94% at 0.5% of Ni loading and temperatures beyond 513 K. Using these parameters, the phenolic hydroxyl group was removed, and the C = C bonds were saturated. This catalyst was also efficient in the hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil. H2-TPR experiments elucidated the synergistic effects between the active component and the carrier, which were considered the main reason for the catalytic activity. Strong influences of the Ni loading and temperature on the hydrogenation of phenol were also observed when the Pd loading was fixed at 1 wt%.

AB  - Abstract: WOx-promoted TiO2–ZrO2 solid acid catalyst was prepared and applied in the catalytic acetalization and ketalization of glycerol with carbonyl compounds to produce biofuel additives. The presence of WOx promoter and TiO2 remarkably improved the catalytic activity of ZrO2. Approximately, 100% glycerol conversion was evidenced with non-bulky aliphatic aldehydes and ketones like, propanol and cyclohexanone. The physical characterization of WOx-promoted TiO2–ZrO2, revealed a higher formation of tetragonal crystalline phase of ZrO2, over monoclinic. The total surface acidity and the ratio of Brønsted to Lewis acidic site concentrations were determined by NH3-TPD and pyridine-chemisorbed FTIR spectroscopy, respectively. A considerably higher concentration of Lewis acidic sites, ~ 213.29 μmol/gm, was evidenced on the WOx-promoted TiO2–ZrO2 catalyst surface. Catalytic activity study revealed a direct correlation between the surface Lewis acidic site concentration and the activity of catalyst. This significant observation indicated the key role of Lewis acidic sites in this catalytic process. The WOx-promoted TiO2–ZrO2 catalyst was also considerably stable and showed good performance in the acetalization/ketalization of glycerol with other substituted carbonyl compounds. Graphic Abstract: The WOx-promoted TiO2–ZrO2 solid acid catalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance for acetalization and ketalization of glycerol with carbonyl compounds to produce biofuel additives.

AB  - Deep eutectic solvent (DES) has been tipped as an upcoming green solvent in biomass processing. In this study, choline-based DES was facilely synthesized and applied for the valorization of banana peel waste. The as-prepared DES shows an excellent performance in the pretreatment of banana peel waste by removing amorphous part of lignin and hemicellulose content as confirmed by SEM, XRD, and FT-IR analysis. Optimization of hydrolysis parameters over heterogeneous catalyst including reaction temperature, catalyst dosage, biomass loading, and reaction time was investigated to attain maximum of 72.9% of TRS yield. The functional moieties such as –SO3H, phenolic –OH, and –COOH groups on the surface of the catalyst play a vital role in the conversion of pretreated banana peel waste to reducing sugars by breaking the cleavage of glycosidic bonds into monomeric sugars. The catalytic hydrolysate was then fermented into bioethanol using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s yeast) and the presence of ethanol was confirmed with potassium dichromate method. As a result, DES pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass will be effective with the combination of catalytic hydrolysis for the production of biofuel. Graphical abstract: Choline-based deep eutectic solvent effectively deconstructs the complex structure of banana peel waste by reducing amorphous lignin and hemicelluloses, while cellulose remains intact. And also, utilization of MCAC favors the hydrolysis process by cleaving the glycosidic linkages on polysaccharides into maximum yield of monomers. The catalytic hydrolysate can produce biofuel via microbial fermentation.

AB  - This study examined acid-catalyzed mechanocatalytic pretreatment of birch sawdust without a separate impregnation step. Catalyst amount and pretreatment time were the key variables. Pretreated material was mixed with water for hydrolysis (100 °C, 60 min). The efficient release of total reducing sugars from birch sawdust is significant to the path towards biofuels and biochemicals. Based on the results, the structure and surface of birch sawdust changed as a function of mechanocatalytic pretreatment. Milling time caused significant transformations in birch structure and also increased the yields of reducing sugars. The highest yield of total reducing sugar from pretreated sawdust was 23.0% after 30 min of hydrolysis with 1.0 mmol/g acid catalyst, whereas the highest glucose yield was 23.8 g/kg (1.5 mmol/g catalyst, 60 min) and the highest xylose yield was 37.5 g/kg (1.0 mmol/catalyst, 30 min). Overall, acid-catalyzed mechanocatalytic treatment seems to improve sugar yields from birch. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Two ruthenium (II) complexes containing heterobidentated phosphorous–nitrogen ligands were studied as homogeneous catalysts in the hydrogenation of furfural, a key step in the transformation of biomass to biofuels or renewable chemicals. The catalysts exhibited high percentages of conversion towards the formation of furfuryl alcohol. The studied ruthenium (II) complexes are able to maintain their catalytic activities in substrate/catalyst ratios ranging from 1000/1 to 6000/1. The reaction is sensitive to hydrogen pressure and the substrate concentration. The maximum conversion is achieved at a pressure of 40 bar and a substrate/catalyst ratio of 3000/1 (TOF 3000 h−1). In situ 1H-NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) analysis suggests that the presence of a phosphorous–nitrogen ligand improves the catalytic activity of the complex by stabilizing the intermediate ruthenium-dihydride, which is considered the active species in the hydrogenation reactions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This work aims to develop the microwave-assisted synthesis route for FAU zeolite. The effect of aging and crystallization times, as well as the use of ultrasonication during the synthesis stages, was studied. A highly crystalline, an extended BET surface area (215.45 m2/g), and a hierarchical nanostructure of faujasite zeolite were obtained using a combined microwave-assisted synthesis with an ultrasonication treatment (MOFAU). The resulting zeolites were used as supports for Pt and Cu catalysts, using a novel polyol impregnation method was possible to achieve an adequate metal loading and homogeneous dispersion of the metal. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scattering and Transmission Electronic Microscopy (SEM and TEM), Temperature-Programed Reduction (TPR), Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and N2 physisorption analyses were used to determine the physicochemical properties of the obtained materials. The prepared materials were used in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of gamma-valerolactone (GVL) using formic acid (FA) as H2 source. The synthesized catalysts presented catalytic activity under the described conditions and 2-MTHF was identified as an interest product observing the highest selectivity with the 3%Pt/MOFAU material. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As a hard-to-decarbonize sector, the shipping industry is experiencing demands to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to alternative low-carbon fuels, to significantly reduce the negative impacts on the environment. Biofuels are regarded as one of the solutions for decarbonization in the marine sector. This paper introduces a lignin-derived drop-in biofuel, 2-methoxy-4-propylphenol (2M4PP), from non-edible feedstocks and investigates engine performance using its 10% (by volume) blend with standard diesel fuel (DF) at variable engine speeds and loads. Results show insignificant difference between the in-cylinder pressures of the proposed blend and DF. The diesel-2M4PP blend emits less carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NOx) than DF at all speeds by up to 39.6% and 10.7% respectively, although its brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is higher. A Ricardo wave model, which is validated with engine experimental data at 2400 rpm speed and full load, is investigated by adjusting injection pressure, injection timing, injection duration and nozzle diameter. The optimal parameters, i.e., 214 bar injection pressure, 6° injection timing, 41.4° injection duration, and 0.37 mm injector orifice, lead to the best engine performance with improved brake power, reduced NOx emissions, and limited influence on BSFC and hydrocarbon emissions compared to DF. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a thermochemical conversion technique that can produce renewable solid biofuel by all types of waste. Waste Camellia oleifera shells (WCOSs) can be used to produce hydrochars via HTC. The effect of HTC temperature on the physicochemical properties and combustion behaviors of hydrochars was analyzed by varying from 150 to 300 °C. The mass yield of hydrochars decreased from 72.45% at 150 °C to 41.88% at 300 °C with the increase in temperature, and the higher heating value increased from 19.22 MJ/kg at 150 °C to 29.97 MJ/kg at 300 °C. The H/C and O/C values reduced from 1.30 and 0.66 of HTC150 to 0.77 and 0.27 of HTC300, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated that the functional groups of hydrochar have changed because of the dehydration and decarboxylation reaction. The surface structure of hydrochars was rougher, and many pore structures were found at 240-300 °C by scanning electron microscopy analysis. The combustion behaviors of WCOSs and their hydochars are distinct via thermogravimetric analysis, and the stability of hydrochars was strengthened with the increase in HTC temperature. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Upgrading renewable biomass into high-valued biofuels and chemicals is highly desirable, however, still remains a challenging task. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is regarded as an effective and promising approach for biorefinery. Herein, the bipyridine ligand with strong metal anchoring capacity is used as a monomer to fabricate porous organic framework (POF) materials. The bipyridine-based POF (named as N-BB) serves as an HDO catalyst support to stabilize PdAg bimetallic nanoparticles. Due to the abundant porous structure of the N-BB support, good dispersity of PdAg nanoparticles, large specific surface area, and synergetic effect of Pd and Ag, the prepared Pd9Ag1/N-BB catalyst exhibits high activity and stability for the HDO of lignin-derived molecules. In addition, the kinetic studies of the hydrogenation of vanillin over Pd9Ag1/N-BB are also carried out, providing strong evidence for the excellent performance of the Pd9Ag1/N-BB catalyst. The Pd9Ag1/N-BB displays a great application prospect in catalytic HDO of lignin-derived compounds. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Lignocellulose is the most abundant source of saccharides and it is therefore a promising feedstock for glycols, such as ethylene-glycol, via catalytic hydrogenolysis of the polysaccharides that it contains. However, this catalytic hydrogenolysis step is hampered by the presence of lignin and other biomass contaminants, such as ash, which need to be removed in a pretreatment step. We propose an organosolv-like pre-treatment that can delignify and de-ash lignocellulose to a level that allows it to be upgraded to glycol with comparable yields to pure cellulose under demanding hydrogenolysis conditions. This work identifies the main design constraints of the integrated process and provides an initial experimental validation of it. Pretreatment of biomass in water/ethanol/acetic acid solutions at 180–200 °C can reduce the lignin content of the solid residue to ≤6 wt%. The addition of an organic acid, such as acetic acid, appears important to improve the removal of the recalcitrant Ca2+, which is a known inhibitor of the tungstate catalyst typically used in this process. The pretreatment medium is designed to use the by-product(s) of the process as organic solvent, to reduce the need for fresh solvent input. However, the process still needs a high solvent recovery (between 93.5 and 99.9 wt%). This can be achieved by selecting volatile component as organic solvent, as it allows recovery by evaporation from the dissolved lignin and ashes. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The production of biodiesel has increased globally during the last decade to overcome the problems of increasing prices of petro-diesel and the depletion of fossil fuels. The present study aimed to utilize agro-waste sugarcane bagasse (SCB) to synthesize a heterogeneous acid catalyst for biodiesel production using waste cooking oil. Waste sugarcane bagasse was converted into biochar through partial carbonization and activated via sulfonation by using acid solutions of different concentration i.e., 1M, 3M, 5M and concentrated sulfuric acid at a sulfonation temperature of 180 °C for 5 h. The prepared catalysts were characterized by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Sulfur (CHNS) analyzer. The prepared catalyst exhibited an excellent surface area of 20.78 m2 g–1 and a total acid density of 3.94 mmol g–1. The biodiesel production process was optimized by varying reaction temperature from (40–70 °C), methanol to oil molar ratio (5:1–20:1), catalyst loading (1–7 wt.%) and reaction time (5–25 min) by using a microwave reactor. The maximum conversion of 95.45% and yield of 92.12% was obtained under optimum conditions: catalyst loading 5 wt%, methanol-to-oil molar ratio (15:1), temperature (60 °C) after 15 min. The results of the experiments were validated by using response surface methodology, which validated the predicted model. The kinetic study of experiments showed that the use of sulfonated catalysts lowered the activation energy (10.5 kJ mol–1) and reactants attained an equilibrium point after a short interval under microwave heating. Reusability of catalyst up to seven cycles with 77.34% yield of biodiesel using low-grade feedstock showed that the catalyst is stable and can be used for sustainable biodiesel production. The utilization of wastes for catalyst synthesis and for biodiesel production can help to minimize the overall production cost of biodiesel. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The use of residual biomass streams for production of liquid fuels will help in achieving the goal of renewable transportation fuels and sustainable society. Hence, efficient, and reliable processes offering a flexible product distribution proven at commercial scale are required. This study explores the technical feasibility of producing gasoline and diesel range hydrocarbons from thermochemical processing of biomass via the production of light olefins (C2-C4) and their subsequent oligomerization through mathematical modelling and simulation using MATLAB software. Different biomass processing scenarios were considered, including a standalone biomass gasification plant and integrated biomass pyrolysis- char gasification (O2- or air-blown) process. Process analysis indicated that the integrated plant offers 10-11% higher carbon efficiency. The processing step with the highest carbon penalty for all the cases is the syngas composition tailoring via water-gas shift reaction. Copyright © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - This study provides computational-assisted engineering of the cellobiohydrolase I (CBH-I) from Penicillium verruculosum with simultaneous enhanced thermostability and tolerance in ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvent, and concentrated seawater without affecting its wild-type activity. Engineered triple variant CBH-I R1 (A65R-G415R-S181F) showed 2.48-fold higher thermostability in terms of relative activity at 65°C after 1 h of incubation when compared with CBH-I wild type. CBH-I R1 exhibited 1.87-fold, 1.36-fold, and 1.57-fold higher specific activities compared with CBH-I wild type in [Bmim]Cl (50 g/L), [Ch]Cl (50 g/L), and two-fold concentrated seawater, respectively. In the multicellulases mixture, CBH-I R1 showed higher hydrolytic efficiency to hydrolyze aspen wood compared with CBH-I wild type in the buffer, [Bmim]Cl (50 g/L), and two-fold concentrated seawater, respectively. Structural analysis revealed a molecular basis for the higher stability of the CBH-I structure in which A65R and G415R substitutions form salt bridges (D64 … R65, E411 … R415) and S181F forms π–π interaction (Y155 … F181), leading to stabilize surface-exposed flexible α-helixes and loop in the multidomain β-jelly roll fold structure, respectively. In conclusion, the variant CBH-I R1 could enable efficient lignocellulosic biomass degradation as a cost-effective alternative for the sustainable production of biofuels and value-added chemicals. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - CO2-neutral fuels are a way to cleaner and more sustainable mobility. Utilization of bio-syngas via Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis represents an interesting route for the production of tailormade biofuels. Recent developments in FT catalyst research led to olefin-enriched products, enabling the synthesis of alcohol-enriched fuels by reductive hydroformylation of the C=C bond. Several alcohols have already proven to be suitable fuel additives with favorable combustion behavior. Here, a hydroformylation-hydrogenation sequence of FT-olefin-paraffin mixtures was investigated as a potential route to alcohols. A liquid-liquid biphasic system with a rhodium/3,3’,3’’-phosphanetriyltris(benzenesulfonic acid) trisodium salt (TPPTS) catalyst system was chosen for effective catalyst recycling. After optimizing reaction conditions with a model substrate consisting of 1-octene and n-heptane the conversion of an actual olefin-containing C5-C10 FT product fraction to alcohols in continuously operated processes for 37 h was achieved with a total turnover number of 23679. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The use of residual oils as raw materials to produce fatty esters in the biodiesel industry is of great interest, as it may improve both the economic and environmental aspects of a process. The use of these residual materials in biofuel production can aggregate value to something that would otherwise be solely disposed of and, as they have lower costs related to the refined oil, its use could reduce operating costs in the industry. However, these resources usually present high free fatty acid (FFA) content. Therefore, considering the traditional biodiesel production process, these fatty acids must be removed before entering the transesterification reactor due to soap formation, which reduces the reaction yield. As a result, to remove these FFA, one of the most common procedures is through the inclusion of a previous step, the esterification reaction. In both esterification and transesterification, short-chain alcohols are generally used to promote FFA and triglycerides conversion into long-chain esters. Concerning the influence associated with the choice of different alcohols, there is a wide variety of process analyses presented in the literature focusing on using only one type of alcohol, usually methanol or ethanol, in both reactions. Nevertheless, the study of a biodiesel production process evaluating the possibility of using the two alcohols at distinct parts in the process is a significant gap to be filled. In this study, an in-depth analysis of the esterification and transesterification reaction kinetics using methanol and ethanol was carried out as a possible optimization variable. In addition, the process simulation concerning the use of different alcohols for each reaction was performed. Several conditions were tested in both reactors before the final alcohol selection, and the use of methanol in the esterification and ethanol in the transesterification reaction presented the most promising results, indicating that a hybrid process concerning alcohol use may bring significant advantages to the process. To validate this theory, a complete process and economic analysis were carried out, evaluating not only the results obtained from the reaction but also the purification steps. Another essential aspect considered in the project is the fatty acid content in the oil, which may vary according to storage conditions and prior use. Thus, the impact due to this fluctuation in the economic aspects was verified. With the simulated base project, different optimizations were made to reduce the entire process's equipment and operational costs. An energy analysis was also developed with the inclusion of energy-saving heat exchangers, which reduced utility costs. Finally, an economic evaluation of the final process was obtained to assess the main variables affecting the project and its payback time. It is essential to say that the kinetic study was based on the content present in the literature, and the simulation was performed on the software Aspen Plus® V10, including the energy and economic analyses. Considering the importance of optimizing the industrial process for biodiesel production and improving its economic aspects, the main target of this study is to demonstrate how the use of different alcohols for the esterification and transesterification reactions may enrich these previously reported vital aspects.

AB  - The mixed-phase barium titanium oxide perovskite nanoparticles were synthesized by calcining barium carbonate and titanium dioxide precursors at 900 °C. The nanoparticles were characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and selective area diffraction analysis. The synthesized barium titanium oxide particles were found to have almost spherical shape with 6-15 nm size. The synthesized mixed-phase BaTiO3/Ba2TiO4 perovskite nanoparticles are used for biofuel production. The formation of methyl ester after the transesterification reaction confirms the conversion of essential oil into biofuel, as analyzed by GC-MS. © 2021 Sumy State University

AB  - A systematic comparison of the use of trioxane and depolymerized paraformaldehyde as formaldehyde precursors for the acetalization of methanol to dimethoxymethane was performed, using the acidic ion exchange resin, Amberlyst 15, as catalyst. Experiments were carried out under isothermal conditions in batch and continuous fixed-bed reactors. The influence of the main operating parameters, temperature (80–120 °C), space time (2.7–6.2 kg h m−3), and feed concentration (12–22 wt% of trioxane/formaldehyde, 2.5 wt% of water on methanol) on reaction rate and product selectivity were evaluated. When using trioxane as reactant, dimethoxymethane is the main reaction product, with more than 90% selectivity. The catalyst was found to be stable during all the experiments (more than 30 h on stream). However, water caused a reversible inhibitory effect on reaction rate, which can be accounted for by using a competitive adsorption model. A mechanistic kinetic model was proposed and validated using the experimental results. When trioxane is used as reactant, its decomposition to formaldehyde was found to be the rate-limiting step of the reaction mechanism (activation energy 73.1 kJ mol−1). This was confirmed with additional experiments, in which trioxane was replaced by depolymerized formaldehyde. In this case, reaction rate considerably increased. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Biodiesel is widely recognized as an environmentally friendly biofuel. The key to the industrial production of biodiesel is the cost of components, especially that of the feedstock. In this study, a green pulsed ultrasound-assisted synthesis method for biodiesel production is reported. The biodiesel was prepared from waste cooking oil by transesterification in the presence of KOH, a homogeneous catalyst, under pulsed high-intensity ultrasonic treatment. The effects of various experimental parameters such as catalyst type, catalyst dosage, molar ratio of oil to methanol, temperature, ultrasonic power, and ultrasonic pulse mode were investigated. The results demonstrated that KOH had high catalytic performance compared to a heterogeneous K3PO4 catalyst for the transesterification of waste cooking oil. The yield of biodiesel reached up to 91.5% in 120 min of reaction time under the most optimal reaction conditions. The reaction conditions included a catalyst dose of 3% KOH, oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:6, temperature of 55°C, ultrasonic intensity of 260 W, and pulse mode of 9 s on/1 s off. Kinetic studies were conducted to obtain the rate constants at various reaction temperatures. The kinetic rate constant was observed to increase with increasing temperatures, and the activation energy for the ultrasonic method was calculated to be 35.9 kJ/mol. Hence, this green method shows great potential for applications in biodiesel production. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Abstract: Open-field burning of rice straw contributes significantly to deterioration of air quality. Similarly, defatted algal residue is a surplus by-product of the algal biofuel industry. This study emphasizes on the two-step conversion of agro-industrial residues (rice straw and Scenedesmus obliquus deoiled biomass) into biodiesel and carotenoids using oleaginous red yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa R2. The effect of biological pretreatment on degradation of lignocellulosic substrates followed by catalytic saccharification was evaluated using suitable analytical techniques. Mixed biomass favoured the growth and secretion of extracellular cellulose degrading enzymes by Penicillium citrinum PKB20 resulting in the highest specific activity of endoglucanase (83.02 IU/mg), xylanase (103 IU/mg) and β-glucosidase (13.8 IU/mg) under solid-state fermentation. The hydrolysis of pre-treated substrate was achieved with a saccharification yield of 41.41 %. Batch fermentation of detoxified hydrolysate amended with synthetic yeast propagation or lipid production media (YEPD or C/N 75) resulted in maximum lipid content and lipid yield of 30.43 % and 1.19 g/L respectively. GC analysis revealed that oleic acid (29.4-50.39 %) was the predominant fatty acid. The crude carotenoid extract was composed of torularhodin, torulene and β-carotene and exhibited strong antioxidant activity.

AB  - This article reports the deliverables of the experimental study on the production of a completely renewable biofuel from Manilkara zapota fruit and seed oil. It was attempted to synthesis ethyl ester from Manilkara zapota seed oil using bioethanol synthesized from decayed Manilkara zapota fruit. Bioethanol was produced through fermentation of decayed Manilkara zapota fruit, waste skin, and pulp with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then distilled at 72°C. The bioethanol yield was noted as 10.45% (v/w). The 95.09% pure bioethanol and 4.9% water molecules were present in the distilled sample. Mechanically extracted raw Manilkara zapota seed oil was used for ethyl ester conversion. The molar ratio of bioethanol to oil, the quantity of KOH, and process temperature were investigated for the maximum yield of Manilkara zapota ethyl ester. A 9:1 molar ratio of bioethanol to oil, 1.5% (w/w) KOH, and 70°C process temperature were identified as enhanced ethanolysis process parameters. The maximum yield of ethyl ester was identified as 93.1%. Physicochemical characteristics of Manilkara zapota oil, bioethanol, and ethyl ester were measured as per the corresponding ASTM standards. It was found that both Manilkara Zapota ethyl ester and bioethanol synthesized from decayed Manilkara zapota fruit could be promising substitutes for fossil diesel and gasoline. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Upgradation of pyrolysis oil is a key process to achieve high-quality biofuel. In this study, the effects of different Ar pressures and H2/Ar ratios in the presence and absence of catalysts on deoxygenation of pyrolysis oil were investigated by autoclaving. When the initial pressure of the reaction is 6MPa and without catalyst addition, the content of carboxylic acid decreases from 51.52 to 41.54%, whereas with the addition of catalyst (10 % Ni/C), the deoxygenation and hydrocarbon content in the product were significantly improved. Hence, 6 MPa was found to be optimum and above which failed to induce such useful changes but can lead to lower high heating value (HHV). However, the presence of hydrogen affects the content of alkanes and olefins in the product. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The production of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) from renewable and abundant biomass feedstock has attracted great attention due to its potential applications in the chemistry and energy industries. As one of the most abundant biomass, glucose has great significance for the production of EMF in large scale. In this study, an efficient one-pot conversion of glucose into EMF catalyzed by ultra-stable Y zeolite (USY) was developed. The effects of process parameters including reaction temperature, reaction time, reactant concentration, and catalyst dosage on EMF yields were systematically investigated, and the respond surface methodology was further used to investigate the interactions of different parameters. Under the optimum reaction conditions of reaction temperature 200 °C, reaction time 10 min, the substrate concentration 100 g·L−1, and catalyst dosage 1.8 ωt%, a EMF yield of 39.5 mol% can be obtained. Moreover, the products distribution was analyzed by GC–MS and a plausible reaction pathway of glucose one-pot alcoholysis reaction catalyzed by USY was put forward accordingly. At the same time, XRD, FTIR, BET, NH3-TPD, and Py-IR were used to characterize the reusability of USY, and the results showed that the structure of the catalyst was kept stable after being reused. After five cycles, the EMF yield was 31.4 mol% suggesting that the catalyst maintained high catalytic activity.

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is one of the main chemical building blocks to generate other high value-added biofuels and biochemicals. This study aimed to produce HMF from fructose dehydration under a biphasic system using various organic acids as catalytic promoters, such as formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, and levulinic acid. Among these organic acids, the acetic acid was found to be the best promoter in this system. The experimental results showed a prominent correlation between the HMF formation and the pKa – the higher pKa gave rise to greater HMF yield and lower activity toward side reactions. Response surface methodology was performed to identify the optimum reaction temperature, time, and promoter concentration for fructose dehydration. Among the three variables, the reaction temperature played the most significant role in fructose conversion and HMF yield. The optimum condition to achieve the highest HMF yield at 72.5% from fructose dehydration was found at 195.8 °C under a mild concentration of acetic acid at 0.075 M for 3.2 min.

AB  - The present experimental work is carried out to analyse the performance, combustion, and exhaust emission characteristics of variable compression ratio (VCR) diesel engine using blended biofuel (B20) with nanoadditives. Transesterified biodiesel was prepared from waste cooking oil (WCO). The cerium oxide nanoparticles (CERIA) were produced and categorized by precipitation technique, SEM and XRD analysis. These nanoadditives mixed with biofuel blend by magnetic stirrer and then by ultrasonication. The test procedure was carried out under the following fuel blends: 20% of biodiesel added to 80% diesel (B20), 15ppm, 30ppm, 45ppm, 60ppm and 75ppm cerium oxide nanoparticles added with B20 blend (diesel, B20, B20+CERIA15, B20+CERIA30, B20+CERIA45, B20+CERIA60, B20+CERIA75). The engine was operated at fixed compression ratio 20:1 and constant speed at various load conditions 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, and results were compared to diesel at 100% load. The improvement in B20 fuel characteristics was observed by adding cerium oxide nanoparticles. The outcomes indicate better improvement in the blended sample of B20+CERIA45 ppm with brake thermal efficiency increased by 3.62% and specific fuel consumption decreased by 3.3% than the neat diesel. Presence of added particles gives better atomization which prompts total burning in the combustion chamber and builds up the amplified pressure data. The emission of CO and HC outflow dimnishes by the addition of CERIA nanoparticles in blended biofuel. Additionally, there is a reduction in NOx by expanding the CERIA dosage in the fuel mixer. This occurs due to CERIA particles presented in a fuel blend behaving as an oxygen buffer and engaging the O2 for decreasing the NOx formation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biomass from microalgae is a potential feedstock for biofuels production. It poses no threat to food security as it does not compete with agricultural crops for arable land. Scenedesmus acutus was used as feedstock to produce bio-oil in a large liquefaction reactor. The influence of reaction temperature (280–360ºC), reaction atmosphere (N2or CO2) and solvent on bio-oil yield, C-16 fatty acid yield and oil properties were investigated. Oils were characterised using gas chromatography, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and ultimate analysis. Higher bio-oil yields were obtained in a CO2atmosphere (250 g.kg-1dry microalgae) than in a N2atmosphere (210 g.kg-1dry microalgae) whilst higher C16 fatty acid concentrations (600 g.kg-1bio-oil) were recorded in N2atmosphere compared to oil prepared in a CO2atmosphere (500 g.kg-1bio-oil). The oil yield increased to a maximum at 320°C, after which there were no significant changes. Highest bio-oil yields (425 g.kg-1dry microalgae) were obtained in ethanol as solvent. FTIR spectroscopy and ultimate analysis showed that proteins present in the feedstock were degraded by breakage of peptide linkages, and nitrogen present in the oils is peptide fragments from protein degradation. The carbon content of all produced oils was high, but the hydrogen content was low, leading to low hydrogen/carbon ratios. Energy consumption and energy efficiency calculations showed that liquefaction in both reaction atmospheres results in a net energy gain, and a CO2atmosphere is best for high energy efficiency. © 2021.

AB  - Green diesel is a second-generation biofuel developed in response to the increasing demand for liquid fuel and the predicted decrease in the availability of fossil fuels, especially diesel as the main liquid fuel used in transportation vehicles. Green diesel can be produced via deoxygenation from various feedstocks, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, fatty acids, and waste cooking oils. Normally, the deoxygenation reaction in green diesel production occurs in a multiphase system. There are three main pathways in the liquid phase of the reaction: decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and hydrodeoxygenation, from which liquid alkane hydrocarbons can be derived, and these are known as green diesel. This review paper discusses several deoxygenation pathways in a multiphase-reaction process to produce green diesel. Nickel metal is a non-noble metal catalyst which has been confirmed from many studies for use in deoxygenation with good performance. The performance of the nickel catalyst depends on different factors including the type of catalyst support and promoter, reaction temperature, reaction pressure, and reaction time. Finally, recent progress and future trends in green diesel production are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The need for sustainability necessitates intensive research on using renewable resources to produce biofuels and biochemicals. The esterification of commercial levulinic acid (LA) into ethyl levulinate (EL) was first optimized using methanesulfonic acid (MsOH) and response surface methodology (RSM). The optimum condition for the esterification of commercial LA into EL was 5.25 h, 90 °C and 2.75 g of MsOH loading. The EL yield and selectivity obtained were 92.2% and 94%, respectively, at a LA conversion of 98%. The effect of various catalysts which are less corrosive and environmentally friendly, namely MsOH and ionic liquids (ILs), was investigated under fixed conditions to determine the best catalyst for the production of EL from LA. The alkyl levulinate ester selectivity from LA conversion was also studied by using linear and branched chain alcohols. The alkyl levulinate ester, ethyl levulinate, was produced from depithed sugarcane bagasse (DSB)-derived LA using a less corrosive homogenous catalyst (methanesulfonic acid). The reaction conditions of 5.25 h, 90 °C and 2.75 g of MsOH loading were used to produce EL from DSB-derived LA with an EL yield of 75%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper aims to reduce the fuel demand for diesel engines through biofuel generation from the waste cooking oil and introducing eco-friendly catalysts from bull bones. The prepared catalyst was characterised to ensure its property before use. The bubble wash method was employed in the waste cooking oil. The transterification process was employed in the production of biofuel. The produced biofuel was characterised to ensure its fuel properties requirement for diesel engine. The primary screening of biodiesel was conducted to optimise the Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) blend with diesel. That is the 20, 40, 60, and 80% mixes with diesel oil and pure WCO (that is B20, B40, B60, B80 and B100) were tested and B20 was initially optimised. The eight kinds of fuels and blends prepared like diesel, B20, B20 with 5% DEE, B20 with 10% DEE, B20 with 5% ethanol, 10% ethanol, B20 with 5% methanol, B20 with 10% methanol were tested in the diesel engine with compression ratios of 15:1 and 18:1 at 5 different load conditions between 0 and 100%. The factorial design and ANOVA tools were used to optimise the experimental data statistically. The compression ratio was optimised and then the optimised fuel and compression ratio was used for further optimisation with negligible emissions like velocity, crank angle and computational fluid dynamics. © 2021, Scibulcom Ltd..

AB  - The macadamia productive process generates a large amount of waste, such as walnut carpel, that is improperly disposed of in most instances. This residue is a promising feedstock for biofuel production and it can be converted through thermochemical routes. Liquid pyrolysis products obtained contain a bio-oil with great potential for the production of fuels and fine chemicals. The goal of this study was to characterize the macadamia carpel for the first time by ultimate, proximate, FTIR, and TG analysis, as well as HHV determination, which showed this is a potential candidate for thermochemical conversion processes. Thermodynamic and kinetic pyrolysis behaviours were evaluated using Ozawa, Kissinger, Starink, and KAS isoconversional models (140.12, 137.69, 137.41, and 146.63 kJ mol−1, respectively), which attested to the product favourability and the operational viability. Additionally, the master plot method was applied to complete the kinetic description, which identified diffusion and nucleation mechanisms during the carpel degradation. After 50% conversion, the third-order reaction mechanism occurred due to a predominant lignin decomposition. The results showed that the macadamia carpel properties are similar to traditional feedstock, that it may be decomposed into bio-oil, and that it can be used as an alternative energy source or bio-chemicals precursor. © 2021 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the biofuel alternatives obtained from vegetable oils and animal fats, currently being used globally to lessen environmental pollutions. In this research investigation, waste banana peels impregnated with calcium oxide (CaO) were utilized as a catalyst in the transesterification reaction of soybean oil with methanol. The waste of banana peels was calcined at 700 °C for 4 h and then added with CaO, calcined at 900 °C for 3 h with different concentrations. The results obtained showed that CaO is successfully impregnated based on the SEM–EDX, the surface area of CaO-CBP was smoother than CaO, the BET results revealed that with CaO-CBP the surface area was increased which was exhibited a porous and rough shape on the calcined banana peel (CBP) to give a high yield. Methyl esters (FAME) are produced at the highest conversion of 76.87 wt. % under 7 wt.% of catalyst amounts, 9:1 of molar ratio of methanol to oil and 2 h reaction time, as optimum conditions. The CaO impregnated with CBP (30% CaO-CBP) was used as a potential catalyst for heterogeneous bases that can facilitate transesterification reaction efficiently due to its high catalytic activity. © 2021, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an important resource for biofuels, chemicals, and bioproducts; however, deconstructing its recalcitrant structure is a challenge. In this study, controlled instant pressure drop (DIC)-assisted alkaline pretreatment process of poppy capsule waste (PCW) was developed and statistically optimized with the aim of enhanced fractionation efficiency and production of fermentable sugars and xylooligosaccharides (XOs). The effects of DIC process variables on PCW fractionation were investigated. The optimal DIC conditions were found as 5 bar vapor pressure, 540 s processing time, and 9% (w/w) moisture content. At the second stage, optimum conditions for alkaline extraction were found as 22.58% (w/w) KOH, 1-h extraction time, and 22.15 mL precipitant volume. Process optimization concluded a hemicellulose separation yield of 26.37±0.08%, corresponding to 104.7% increase. Process optimization also contributed to the sustainability of the process by reducing KOH and precipitant consumption by 9.7% and 11.4%, respectively, with a concurrent shortening of the processing time from 24 to 1 h. DIC pretreatment enhanced the enzymatic hydrolysis yield of PCW, and a maximum glucan-to-glucose conversion yield of 22.85±0.74% was obtained, which corresponds to a 9-fold increase. Hydrolysis of PCW and hemicellulose-rich fraction by xylanase yielded xylose-free xylobiose (X2) as the principal product. SEM analysis demonstrated the expansion of PCW structure by DIC pretreatment, reasoning the higher fractionation efficiency and enzymatic hydrolysis yields. The optimized process could be an efficient option for lignocellulose fractionation, enzymatic saccharification, and XOs production within biorefinery concept while reducing the requirement for chemicals and processing time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Fossil fuels are the primary energy source of almost all societies and economies, but it is finite and scarce. The use of non-renewable fossil fuels threatens earth’s environment. At the same time, waste from agricultural and industrial activities is increasing. Most of this waste is discarded or poorly managed, causing many other environmental issues. Converting waste to energy is a promising route to address these challenges. We investigated the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of high moisture content, tobacco-processing waste in a multiple batch thermal reactor to produce biocrude oil. The effects of operating conditions were studied and optimized for maximum liquid biocrude oil yield. HTL operating conditions considered were temperatures from 280 to 340 °C and residence times from 15 to 45 min for a fixed ratio of biomass to deionized water of 1:3. The reaction temperature was found to affect the yields and distribution of products significantly. The maximum yield of the liquid biocrude oil obtained was more than 52% w/w at 310 °C and 15 min. Under these conditions, almost 90% of the energy was recovered in biocrude oil and solid products. The liquid fraction was mainly composed of phenols, ketones, and nitrogenous compounds. This study provides a potential framework for eco-technologies for biomass waste-to-energy conversion with respect to converting tobacco processing residues to liquid biofuels and biochemicals.

AB  - An economical way to reduce oil consumption and environmental problems in fuel production is the production of biodiesel from by-products and waste materials. By-products from the vegetable oil refining industry such as soap stock, acid oil, and fatty acid distillates are suitable for biodiesel production. In this study, biodiesel production was made using deodorizer distillate, which is the last step of the sunflower oil refining stage. Sunflower oil deodorizer distillate (SODD) obtained from oil facilities in Thrace region, and it was examined whether the fuel characteristics of the produced biodiesel comply with EN 14214 and ASTM D6751 standards. Biodiesel production from SODD was based on acidic catalysis method. H2SO4 was used as catalyst and methanol as alcohol. Catalyst amount, methanol to SODD ratio, reaction temperature and reaction time parameters were studied and optimum conditions were determined. As a result of the studies, the highest biodiesel yield was obtained in 1 wt% H2SO4, 12:1 methanol to SODD ratio, 65 °C reaction temperature, and 9-h reaction time. Biodiesel achieved 98.98% methyl ester concentration and 94.32% biodiesel yield. In addition, comparison of fuel properties of synthesized biodiesel with ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 showed well-matched values. Our study thus recommends SODD as a non-edible potential feedstock for biofuel production and industrial purposes.

AB  - Palm fatty acid distillate PFAD is an example of potential low-cost palm biofuel second generation feedstock, most used as a source of fatty acid for non-food applications in industry. Catalytic application of Oxone® salt was used in the present study for the esterification reaction of PFAD for biodiesel production for the first time. After optimizing the conversion rate, was possible to observe that, among the process variables studied [Oxone® concentration (%), temperature (°C) and reaction time (h)], Oxone® concentration was the only significant variable for the fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) generation response variable. A > 90% conversion rate was reached with 15% Oxone® at 42 °C, using a PFAD:ethanol molar ratio of 1:5 at 12 h reaction time. The reaction system has a series of advantages, such as mild conditions, simple operation, green and high conversion. As alternative for make the biodiesel production as sustainable as possible.

AB  - Methods for the synthesis of ester non-toxic biodegradable plasticizers (hazard class 4) using renewable raw materials have been developed: glycerine-containing waste generated in the production of biofuels; citric acid 244, by microbial synthesis from molasses sugar production waste; polyatomic alcohol (neopoliol) – trimethylolpropane – a product of oxosynthesis obtained on the basis of natural gas. The target products are esters with a molecular weight range of 250-600, with low saturated vapor pressure, good thermal stability and polymer compatibility, and chemical inertia. The results of complex researches of processes of esterification of carboxylic ac-ids with hydroxyl compounds in industrial homogeneous catalysts of different acidity (sulfuric ac-id, p-toluensulfonate, phosphoric acid) allowed determining the main approaches to the selection of raw materials chemical composition. This took into account the availability and toxicological characteristics and evaluation of the technological characteristics of esterification process to in-crease the conversion of raw materials and achieve a high selectivity for the target product. It is shown that to overcome the thermodynamic limitation in all processes, it is necessary to use a 6-7-fold molar excess of the second reagent: acid or alcohol. A solvent (benzene, toluene) is added to the initial mixture, which maintains a constant temperature and removes the reaction water in the form of an azeotrope. To isolate the target products from the reaction mass, it is proposed to use a film evaporator operating under vacuum (p=5-10 mm Hg, t=105-120 ℃). Samples of tributyrin glycerin, triamyl citrate and triethanoate purity ≥ 98% were obtained. The main physical-chemical properties were determined. A comparison with known industrial analogues was carried out. Evaluation of key quality indicators confirms the possibility of their use as plasticizers in the formulation of PVC pastes. © 2021.

AB  - According to India’s National Biofuel Policy, only non-edible oilseed crops can be used for the biofuel feedstock. In this context, Camelina sativa is one such plant that fulfils all the criteria defined by the Biofuel policies of India. So, the present investigation was aimed to examine C. sativa seed oil capabilities as a biodiesel feedstock. Oil was deacidified via adsorption method apply-ing Silica Gel as an adsorbent. The highest efficacy was obtained when 1:9 (Silica gel: oil) ratio was applied and the acid value was reduced from 6.45 to 2.78 mg KOH/g. Furthermore, oil was transesterified using methanol in the ratio of 1:6 (oil: methanol molar ratio) and 0.8 % (w/w of oil) of KOH as a catalyst at 70 °C. The produced biodiesel was analyzed in terms of fuel-specific parameters and results were compared with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. The results were very much satisfactory and under the limits specified by the ASTM standards. The results revealed that oil to biodiesel conver-sion was 92.28 % with an acid value of 0.37 mg KOH/g. The measured Iodine value was 152 gI2/100g indicated the high unsat-uration. Still, Camelina biodiesel showed oxidation stability of 6 h., which was a decent value compared to this much unsatura-tion. The sulphur content was also higher (24 ppm) than the specified limit (15 ppm). Besides, the fuel-specific parameters like sulphur content and iodine value were under the ASTM limits. © Author (s).

AB  - Broad assessment is being directed everywhere by the researchers on the world to identify the alternative sources for eco-friendly fuel. In the present investigation, biodiesel was integrated from the waste avocado seeds. Since the seed is a bio-squander that has the fundamental supplements and unsaturated fats, there is a need to use this waste and convert them into a valuable item. The biodiesel production process includes two-step processes. The first step is extraction of oil from the seed by using ethanol as a solvent. The viable extraction was obtained with the optimum conditions were found to be at 80°C, with the solvent to feed the proportion of 7:2, 3 hours of extraction time. Kinetic models were developed for the extraction processes with an R2 value of 0.959 and 0.989. The second step is producing biodiesel from the extracted oil by transesterification process. Operating conditions used for the trans-esterification reaction were observed to be 60°C, KOH to oil weight proportion of 1% and oil to methanol mole proportion 1:6. The biodiesel properties were estimated and contrasted and benchmarks which demonstrated that the biodiesel could be utilized as an elective vitality asset in diesel engines. This research work comprises two principle goals. Initially, a numerical model was obtained to anticipate the best states of extraction of lipids from a dried avocado seed. Second, utilizing the lipid separated from the seed, the biodiesel must be produced. GCMS examined the acquired biodiesel, and the diesel properties were investigated. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The problem of crude oil reserve shortage and air quality decline currently have led researches on renewable fuel such as bioethanol and biohydrogen. The attempt to provide such biofuel involves the utilization of enormously available wasted materials, lignocellulose. Coconut husk is one of such materials available in Indonesia. The previous work had reported the quantity of total reducing sugar produced after the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated coconut husk. The pretreatment methods used were dilute sodium hydroxide solution (1 and 4% w/v), 1,3-methylmethylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate ionic liquid and the combination of both methods. This work focused on constructing the mathematical model which describes the kinetic of those enzymatic hydrolysis reactions. Mathematical model expressions help describing as well as predicting the process behavior, which is commonly needed in the process design and control. The development of mathematical model in this work was done based on the total reducing sugar concentration resulted in batch hydrolysis reaction. The kinetic parameters including initial available substrate (S0), maximum reaction rate (rmax), and half-maximum rate constant (KM). According to the values of half-maximum rate constant (KM), the enzymatic hydrolysis performance of coconut husk treated using ionic liquid is better than that treated using dilute alkaline solution as the former had shown lower KM value and hence higher enzyme affinity to the substrate. The best hydrolysis result was performed using combination of 1% dilute sodium hydroxide solution and ionic liquid with kinetic model parameter of 0.5524 g/L.h of rmax, 0.0409 g/L of KM, and 4.1919 g/L of S0.

AB  - This work demonstrated the use of green material catalysts, produced from Sengon sawdust waste, to obtain nanocellulose biopolymers. The green material catalysts were utilized as catalysts support of TiO2−ZrO2 binary oxide in the form of nanocomposite materials with superior synergistic properties. The isolation of nanocellulose was achieved using a hydrolysis method with a yield of 63.40%. The TiO2 and ZrO2 nanoparticles have average particle sizes of around 25 and 15 nm, respectively, and the binary oxides of TiO2–ZrO2 pretained an average particle size of 30 nm were used. Furthermore, the nanocellulose combined with the TiO2−ZrO2 binary oxide had formed a cellulose/TiO2−ZrO2 nanocomposite with an average particle size of 30 nm. This indicates that the supporting nanocellulose can stabilize the nanoparticles and avoid aggregation. Moreover, the nanocomposites can be used as a catalyst for the conversion of glucose to 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (5-EMF). The catalytic activity increased with the nanoparticle effect obtained ZrO2, TiO2, TiO2-ZrO2, and cellulose and TiO2-ZrO2 nanocomposite, in 15.50%, 20.20%, 35.20%, and 45.50% yields, respectively. The best yield of 5-EMF was 45.50%, with reaction conditions of 1:1 TiO2–ZrO2 ratio, 4 h reaction time, and 160 °C reaction temperature. The use of nanocellulose biopolymer generated from Sengon sawdust waste in Indonesia provides a promising catalyst support material as an alternative green catalyst. In addition, the glucose carbohydrates can be converted to biofuel feedstocks in the development of a renewable alternative energy. Copyright © 2021 by Authors, Published by BCREC Group.

AB  - The continued burning of fossil fuels since the beginning of the last century led to higher emissions of greenhouse gases and thus leads to global warming. Microalgae are one of the most important sources of green hydrocarbons because this type of algae has a high percentage of lipids and has rapid growth, consumes the carbon dioxide in large quantities. Besides, the cultivation of these types of algae does not require arable land. This review aims to explain the suitability of microalgae as a biofuel source depending on the fat content, morphology, and other parameters and their effect on the conversion processes of microalgae oil into biofuels by different zeolite catalytic reactions. It also discusses in detail the major chemical processes that convert microalgae oil to chemical products. This review sheds light on one of the most important groups of microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris microalgae). This review includes a historical overview and a comprehensive description of the structure needed to develop this type of algae. The most important methods of production, their advantages and disadvantages are also deliberated in this work. Copyright © 2021 by Authors, Published by BCREC Group.

AB  - The applications of lignocellulosic wastes to produce a wide variety of products, including biochemicals, biomaterials, and biofuels, can be an effective solution for utilizing these valuable waste materials. In this study, the production of furan building blocks from bagasse fibers was investigated by treating unbleached fibers with NMMO, [Bmim]Cl, and TMAH at different temperatures using AlCl3 and CrCl2 as the catalysts. The resulted liquors were extracted with CH2Cl2 to obtain furan rich fraction. Analysis of extracted fractions with GC/MS indicates the production of various furanic compounds due to catalytic solvolysis with different solvents at elevated temperatures. 2(3H)-Furanone and 2-methyl-THF were the main products of catalytic treatment of bagasse fibers with NMMO. Treatment by [Bmim]Cl resulted in 2,5-dihydro furanone as the dominant product at elevated temperatures. Furan carboxylic acid methyl ester and 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester were the main TMAH reaction products with unbleached fibers. The results indicate that the type of solvent affects the solvolysis rate and dehydration of cellulose to furanic compounds. Moreover, increasing the temperature led to an increase in the formation of the furanic compounds.

AB  - Graphene oxide, which exhibits extraordinary acidic properties and a high theoretical surface area, is a good candidate for the catalytic transformation of biomass resources to valuable chemicals and biofuels. In this study, graphene oxide was prepared through various graphite oxide exfoliation methods, including sonication, microwave irradiation, and freeze-thaw cycling, and the activity of the prepared catalysts was evaluated in the saccharification of cellulose. The results indicated that graphene oxide prepared via these methods exhibited superior catalytic performances compared to graphite oxide; however, no significant difference in the catalytic activity of the graphene oxide catalysts was observed based on the exfoliation method used. Therefore, we proposed that thinning of graphite oxide improves its catalytic activity by increasing the contact efficiency between the substrate and the catalyst; however, this is not dependent on the exfoliation method used to prepare the graphene oxide. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In Brazil and worldwide, there are several challenges for strengthening and expanding the use of renewable sources to obtain chemical and energy inputs, with the objective of consolidating a sustainable industrial segment. In this context, lignocellulosic biomass is an excellent renewable and sustainable source. In this work, a brief review is presented on the use of tin catalysts in obtaining platform molecules, from fructose conversion, that can be transformed into a numerous products, as cosmetics, polymers, fungicides and biofuels. It is clear how versatile fructose can be in the face of the formation of different products of industrial importance. In addition, emphasis is given to the fructose reaction mechanisms for obtaining important carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones and acids) and the influence of tin sites on the reaction routes. This review leads to the conclusion that even though there are many processes that use tin catalysts, there are many opportunities for the development of new catalytic processes and materials, as well as in the elucidation of the possible mechanistic ways of converting fructose in the presence of such systems. © 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - The increasing demand for energy and the fact that petroleum, which is the most used energy source, has a limited reserve, have led researchers to search for new and renewable energy sources. In this context, biofuels such as biodiesel and bio alcohols have been studied and used in internal combustion engines for a long time. However, with the developments in technology, the production and use of such alternative fuels in different engine technologies is still a subject of research. In this regard, isopropanol-butanol-ethanol (IBE) has received an increasing attention over standard alcohols and its potential as a substitute for other alcohol fuels in internal combustion engines has been researched recently. Therefore, the purpose of the experimental study is to investigate the effect of biodiesel addition at rates of 20% and 40% by volume in a blend of IBE (30% v/v) with petroleum-based diesel (70% v/v) on the combustion and emission characteristics of a single-cylinder common-rail direct injection engine at constant engine speed of 2400 rpm and 60% load conditions. Experimental results showed that all blended fuels presented a potential to reduce smoke opacity by 27% − 41%, CO emissions by 44% − 66% and unburnt HC emissions (up to 31.8%) but increase NOx emissions by 5% − 24.6% compared to diesel. However, adding biodiesel caused to a slight increase in smoke opacity and CO emissions while decrease in unburned HC and NOx emissions compared to the blend of IBE and diesel. Combustion analysis also showed that the use of blended fuels led to the increase of peak cylinder pressure (by 7%) and the significant improvement in the rate of heat release was observed, which further increased with the addition of biodiesel to blend of IBE and diesel. It was concluded that ternary blends was performed better than the blend of IBE and diesel while biodiesel addition was found to be beneficial in terms of reduction of unburnt HC and NOx emissions along with improved performance. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Graphene oxide (GO) is a promising membrane system for chemical separation applications due to its 2-D nanofluidics properties and an ability to control interplanar spacing for selectivity. The permeance of water, methanol (MeOH) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) through 5 µm thick membranes was found to be 0.38 ± 0.15, 0.33 ± 0.16 and 0.42 ± 0.31 LMH/bar (liter/m2·h·bar), respectively. Interestingly, the permeance of a water–alcohol mixture was found to be dramatically lower (~0.01 LMH/bar) than any of its components. Upon removing the solvent mixture, the transmembrane flux of the pure solvent was recovered to near the original permeance. The interlayer space of a dried GO membrane was found to be 8.52 Å, which increased to 12.19 Å. 13.26 Å and 16.20 Å upon addition of water, MeOH and IPA. A decrease in d-space, about 2 Å, was consistently observed when adding alcohol to water wetted GO membrane and an optical color change and reduction in permeance. A newly proposed mechanism of a partial reduction of GO through a catalytic reaction with the water–alcohol mixture is consistent with experimental observations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Macroalgal biomass for bioethanol production has proved to be a viable alternative to feedstocks of first-generation (food crops rich in starch) and second-generation biofuel (agricultural residues and woody biomasses rich in lignocellulosic components). Production of bioethanol from biomass involves fermentation of mixed monosugars such as glucose, xylose, galactose, rhamnose, mannose, and fucose, and abundant monomer is found in algal biomass as well as lignocellulosic biomass. The inability of commonly used Saccharomyces cerevisiae to ferment xylose (pentose) sugar has led to the exploration of robust yeast strains that can utilize mixed sugars to produce ethanol. This study focuses on the isolation of yeast strains from various fruits and fermented products to determine efficacy in ethanol production using synthetic and macroalgal sugar. Two strains prioritized based on ethanol yield are Meyerozyma caribbica (isolated from cashew-fermented juice) and Pichia kudriavzevii (isolated from toddy). Strain P. kudriavzevii is thermotolerant (at 45 °C), whereas M. caribbica is tolerant to high salinity and produced ethanol of 2.6 g/L from 5.95 g/L of sugar, achieving 88.8% fermentation efficiency. P. kudriavzevii strain exhibits ethanol tolerance up to 4%. Fermentation of synthetic glucose produced 1.35 g/L and 1.44 g/L ethanol by M. caribbica and P. kudriavzevii strains with fermentation efficiencies of 83.6% and 94.8% respectively. M. caribbica strain fermented xylose and produced 1.4 g/L of ethanol achieving 14.9% fermentation efficiency, while simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process using P. kudriavzevii strain exhibited efficiency of 65.1% and 80.9% for Enteromorpha intestinalis and Ulva lactuca respectively. Cellulolytic activity of the prioritized strains was determined to carry out consolidated bioprocess.

AB  - Synthesizing ring structure aviation fuels from biomass-derived platform molecules is challenging, especially for bridged ring structure aviation fuels which are typically achieved from fossil-derived chemicals. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of ring structure biofuels in two steps by a combination of a solvent-free Michael-cyclization reaction and a hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction from lignocellulose-derived 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione. These biofuels are obtained with high overall yields up to 90%, which exhibit high densities of 0.81 g cm−3-0.88 g cm−3 and high volumetric neat heat of combustion (VNHOC) values of 36.0 MJ L−1-38.6 MJ L−1. More importantly, bridged-ring structure hydrocarbons can also be achieved in two steps by a combination of a Robinson annulation reaction and an HDO reaction to afford the final products at high overall yields up to 90%. The bridged-ring structure products have comparable high densities and high VNHOC values to the best artificial fuel JP-10 (0.94 g cm−3 and 39.6 MJ L−1). The results demonstrate a promising way for the synthesis of high-density aviation fuels with different fuel properties at high yields. © 2021 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different silica types on iron (Fe)-based catalysts containing copper and potassium prepared by autocombustion for direct use in Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) without a reduction step. The catalysts were characterized through nitrogen (N2) adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The FTS performance of each catalyst was evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor at 300 °C, 1.0 MPa, a catalyst weight to volume flow rate of 10 gcat h/mol and a hydrogen (H2)/carbon monoxide (CO) molar ratio of 1. The pore size of the silica had an important influence on the formation of the Fe active phases and subsequent FTS activity. The presence of iron carbide (FexC), which is known to be one of the active Fe phases, was demonstrated by the XRD and TEM analyses. Larger crystallite sizes in the large pores were much easier to accommodate FexC than the smaller crystallite sizes in the small pores. The Fe-based catalysts supported on the silica with the largest pores gave the highest CO conversion level at 86.5%, with a 28.1% C2-4 selectivity and 17.3% C5+ selectivity under these operating conditions. Interestingly, this is an alternative approach to synthesize nanostructured metallic catalysts on silica and to produce clean biofuel for the fuel industry and transportation. © 2021, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

AB  - The high content of silica is present in beach sand and this silica can be synthesized into mesoporous silica (MS) using the sonochemistry assisted with dodecyl-amine (DDA) as a surfactant template. The preparation began by adding sodium silicate dropwise to DDA solution under the rotation speed of 120 rpm. The mixture was then added with H2SO4 and sonicated at 37 kHz at a temperature of 35 °C for 20 min. The product was then filtered, washed, and dried at 50 °C then calcined at 600 °C for 5 h. After it was calcined, the sample was characterized by using FTIR, Surface Area Analyzer, XRD, SEM, and TEM as well as the acidity using pyridine vapour adsorption. The synthesized MS was then used as a catalyst in hydrocracking waste cooking oil in a semi-batch stainless steel reactor system at 450 °C for 2 h, under 20 ml/min H2 flow rate. The hydrocracking product of the liquid fraction was analyzed using GC-MS. The results showed that the best performance of the MS1 was produced by using the DDA concentration of 0.1 M. It had optimum acidity at 1.7 mmol/g specific surface area of 233 m2/g, with the total pore volume of 0.4 cc/g, and average pore diameter of 7.70 nm. The best MS1 catalyst produced liquid fraction with a yield of 31.13 wt.% which consisted of 11.10% diesel oil and 5.04% gasoline. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Catalytic activity of materials prepared by means of sodium ion-exchange by potassium and cesium in NaY zeolite, was studied in the deoxygenation of methyl laurate, as biodiesel model compound. The increase of the Ion-exchange produced a basicity increase that leads to a lower deactivation in the deoxygenation of methyl laurate, reaching a steady conversion of about 92% for 4 h (time on stream, TOS) with the CsKY zeolite. However, the potassium ion exchange leaded to higher production of bio-hydrocarbons, especially unsaturated (96% of the C10, C11 and C12 production), with higher production of C11 by means of decarbonylation. Furthermore, mesoporosity on the KY zeolite was generated, using SDBS (sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate) during the synthesis, with the aim of increasing its capacity to process bulky molecules. The presence of mesoporosity in the potassium zeolite allowed a higher tolerance to deactivation maintaining a steady conversion of about 90% for 4 h TOS. The yield to desirable products (C10 to C12 hydrocarbons) was about 37%. Therefore, biofuel upgrading can be carried out using potassium Y zeolite with mesoporosity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Offretite zeolite synthesis in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr) is reported. The offretite crystals were synthesized with a high crystallinity and hexagonal prismatic shape after only 72 h of hydrothermal treatment at 180◦C. The CTABr has dual-functions during the crystallization of offretite, viz. as structure-directing agent and as mesoporogen. The resulting offretite crystals, with a Si/Al ratio of 4.1, possess more acid sites than the conventional offretite due to their high crystallinity and hierarchical structure. The synthesized offretite is also more reactive than its conventional counterpart in the acylation of 2-methylfuran for biofuel production under non-microwave instant heating condition, giving 83.5% conversion with 100% selectivity to the desired product 2-acetyl-5-methylfuran. Hence, this amphiphile synthesis approach offers another cost-effective and alternative route for crystallizing zeolite materials that require expensive organic templates. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Converting the chemical and biologically resistant structure of cellulosic biomass into useful products is a technological and economic challenge. The use of sustainable and efficient conversion technology sustainably has been gaining prominence. This work aimed to evaluate the integration of subcritical water hydrolysis (SWH) and enzymatic hydrolysis of sugarcane straw to obtain fermentable products and second-generation ethanol. SWH was conducted under semi-continuous conditions at 200 °C, 5 mL/min, and a 19-min retention time. Enzymatic hydrolysis using an enzyme blend produced simple sugars that were evaluated for fermentation using two strategies: (i) Saccharomyces cerevisiae SA-1; and (ii) co-culture of S. cerevisiae SA-1 and Scheffersomyces stipitis NRRLY-7124. Integrating subcritical water and enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in greater fermentable sugar yield (2.40 ± 0.01 g/L of xylose and 8.9 ± 0.6 g/L of glucose) than subcritical pre-treatment on its own. The co-culture fermentation strategy was more efficient than fermentation by S. cerevisiae on its own, resulting in 2.8 ± 0.3 g/L of ethanol. Subcritical water hydrolysis pre-treatment disrupted the lignocellulosic matrix, leading to increased enzymatic accessibility of cellulose, with minimal formation of degradation compounds, and with minimal waste formation. Future work can optimize the hydrolysis process to increase the yield of simple sugars, increase fermentation efficiency by controlling oxygen concentration and removing acetic acid, and consequently increase the yields of second-generation ethanol.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass represents a suitable feedstock for production of biofuels and bioproducts. Its chemical composition depends on many aspects (e.g. plant source, pre-processing) and it has impact on productivity of industrial bioprocesses. Numerous methodologies can be applied for biomass characterisation, with acid hydrolysis being a particularly relevant step. This study intended to assess the most suitable procedures for acid hydrolysis, taking Eucalyptus globulus bark as a case study. For that purpose, variation of temperature (90-120 °C) was evaluated over time (0-5 h), through monosaccharides and oligosaccharides contents and degradation. For glucose, the optimal conditions were 100 °C for 2.5 h, reaching a content of 48.6 wt.%. For xylose, the highest content (15.2 wt.%) was achieved at 90 °C for 2 h, or 120 °C for 0.5 h. Maximum concentrations of mannose and galactose (1.0 and 1.7 wt.%, respectively) were achieved at 90 and 100 °C (2-3.5 h) or at 120 °C (0.5-1 h). These results revealed that different hydrolysis conditions should be applied for different sugars. Using this approach, total sugar quantification in eucalyptus bark was increased by 4.3%, which would represent a 5% increase in the ethanol volume produced, considering a hypothetical bioethanol production yield. This reflects the importance of feedstock characterization on determination of economic viability of industrial processes. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021.

AB  - Biofuels are one of the most sought-after renewable energy sources to overcome the current energy crisis in the world. Diesel blended with esters derived from oils has shown appreciable results for its use in compression ignition engines. In this work, B20 (20% biodiesel + 80% diesel by volume) fuel blend comprising 80% diesel and 20% biofuel extracted from waste cooking oil is used as a fuel. Two different metallic oxide nanoparticles (NPs), namely, cerium oxide (CeO2) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3) each having size of 30 nm, are dispersed in B20 biodiesel blend and used to investigate their combined influence on engine combustion. Experiments are conducted to study the engine exhaust emissions of a single cylinder four-stroke diesel engine running at constant speed of 1,500 rpm with varying engine loads. Experiments are carried out with B20 fuel and adding mixtures of CeO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles in 50–30, 40–40 and 30–50 ppm, respectively, to B20 biodiesel blend. Responses recorded are the emissions of CO, HC, CO2, NOx and smoke. The results reveal that, on adding the nanoparticles, the engine observed a smooth combustion with reduction in the exhaust emissions compared to neat B20 biodiesel operation. B20 blend with 50 ppm of CeO2 and 30 ppm of Al2O3 nanoparticles showed lower exhaust emissions compared to other fuel blends. For the best fuel blend, CO, HC, NOx and smoke are reduced by 57.3%, 22.3%, 24.3% and 7.36%, respectively, compared to neat B20 operation. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - In this work, we report the one-pot fabrication of nanoarchitectured hydrotalcite (HT)/SBA-15 composites via a facile in-situ mesoporous templating approach. The characterization studies conferred that the successful incorporation of HT into the SBA-15 mesopores and the formation of composites. These composites showed excellent performance towards the catalytic conversion of biomass-derived levulinic acid (LA) to a biofuel additive ethyl levulinate (EL). The enhancement in the selectivity of EL was observed from 69 to 97% with the incorporation of HT into SBA-15. The experimental results revealed that the catalytic activity of the composites was thoroughly influenced by the density of surface basic sites and surface area. Among all the composites, HTS-2 outperforms the highest EL selectivity of 97.2% with remarkable stability and recyclability. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This study analyzed the fuel properties of the bio-oil obtained from pyrolysis of Tectona grandis at different temperatures (400, 500, 600, and 700oC) in a fixed bed reactor. The feedstock was characterized using proximate and ultimate analyses. The elemental composition of the bio-oils as well as their fuel properties, including the pH value, density, viscosity, higher heating value (HHV), moisture and ash content, flash point, pour point, and carbon residue, were determined. The percentage ranges of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen in the bio-oils were 75.80 76.50, 8.93 8.98, 4.24 4.46, 0.11 0.21, and 10.50 10.88 wt.%, respectively. The pH values of the derived bio-oils (2.7 3.3) were lower than those of diesel (5.5 8.0) while their densities at 40oC (1.10 1.15 g/cm3) were comparable to those of fuel oil (0.9101 g/cm3), furnace oil (0.92 g/cm3), and heavy fuel oil (0.9888 g/cm3), measured at 30oC, with their viscosities (29 34 mPas) higher than those of gasoline (< 0.3 mPas) and diesel (3 4 mPas). The HHVs of the bio-oils (36.47 36.76 MJ/kg) were lower than those of gasoline (44 46 MJ/kg) and diesel (42 46 MJ/kg). The flash points of the bio-oils at 500, 600, and 700oC (50, 55, and 48oC, respectively) were lower than that of diesel (58.5oC). With some upgrading, bio-oil from Tectona grandis pyrolysis can be a substitute for conventional liquid fuels. © 2021 Begell House Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - A Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) was conceived by using garden soil as a source to culture. It was then utilized as a bio-catalyst to decompose waste organic matter, reduce pollution from the soil, and produce energies. The MFC was composed of a bio-anode inoculated with a mixture of garden compost leachate and an abiotic stainless steel cathode. Besides, the bio-anode consisted of a Nafion membrane modified with carbon. The microorganisms agglomerated under polarization and formed electroactive bio-film onto bio-anode. In the preliminary test of MFC, potassium hexacyanoferrate has been utilized as catholyte, to enhance the reduction of proton and electrons resulting in a higher voltage. However, this electrolyte is toxic and oxidized rapidly, thus substituted by the hydrochloric acid. The results showed that the MFC with modified Nafion, gave relatively high current-density 379 mA/m2 in two days, whereas the conventional biofuel cell without modification attained the current-density 292 mA/m2 in four days. Nevertheless, both cells yielded almost the same current density of 20 mA/m2 during 60 days. Although it has been used for a long time, the modified Nafion has not been corroded and preserved its physicochemical properties. © 2021, Gadjah Mada University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microalgae are increasingly being preferred as sustainable biomass feedstock for biofuels production due to their high growth rate and lipid yield. However, optimal production requires the use of economical native microalgal species which are well adapted to local climatic and ecological conditions. Therefore, this study’s main objective was to isolate and select local microalgal species for prospective biofuels production. Serial dilution and streak plate techniques were used to isolate four species: Chlorella, Scenedesmus, Oscillatoria and Microcystis from Manyame River, Zimbabwe. The isolates were evaluated for their biomass and lipid productivity under artificial lighting (8:16 h light/dark cycle) and a temperature of 25 ± 3°C. Lipid quantification was done gravimetrically, using hexane as an extraction solvent. Each isolate’s performance was compared against that of an imported Chlorella vulgaris strain. Amongst the isolates, Chlorella sp. exhibited a highly competitive growth rate of 0.26 d−1 and lipid yield of 37.16% dry cell weight. In comparison, the imported C. vulgaris had a growth rate of 0.226 d−1 and lipid yield of 35.74% dry cell weight. Although findings suggest that the native Chlorella sp. is the ideal candidate, growth enhancement and genetic engineering techniques may be used to further improve its biomass and lipid yield. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Early studies have shown that biofuels in powder form burn like a gas. In addition, they are less pollutants and renewable source. In this study, powder biofuel is investigated as a direct solid fuel in internal combustion engine. The biofuel is applied in a cylindrical shape and micron-size, with length between 75–5800 μm and diameter 30–1380 μm. Several mathematical models were investigated including different stages of biomass powder combustion in the engine. The mathematical models include drying, shrinkage, and volatilization processes. The modelling tools also investigated the movement of the fuel powder in the cylinder upon injection, how it is distributed, and its performance before combustion. The proposed models are simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools and validated against experiments. The results showed that all models can represent the biomass powder combustion reasonably. However, some models are least expensive in calculations and time. Results also displayed that the powder are traced in different groups based on sizes and flow responses and that takes about 0.2 s. The biomass powder gasification is completed at temperature 1050 K and extra temperature has no meaning. © 2021 THE AUTHOR

AB  - Among alternative transport fuels, biodiesel is an eco-friendly substitute for petrodiesel. The quality of biodiesel is dependent on the composition of feedstock oils used for its preparation. The mathematical/statistical tools are used to determine the biodiesel properties, and their outputs are further compared with experimental results for their consistency and reliability. To reduce the cost, efforts and resources, the current study aims to evaluate the predicting ability of the standalone software BiodieselAnalyzer. In the present study, properties of 45 biodiesels are predicted using BiodieselAnalyzer software and the obtained results are compared with earlier published literature. The % absolute relative deviation was found as 4.47% and 5.31% for density and higher heating value, respectively, but the highest deviation was found for kinematic viscosity (70.19%), oxidation stability (131.19%), cloud point (118.57%) and cold filter plugging point (234.17%). The results indicate that the software shows a good performance in predicting the density and higher heating value; however, the software shows poor reliability in predicting kinematic viscosity, oxidation stability, cloud point and cold filter plugging point. This inconsistency might be due to the non-inclusion of factors such as minor oil components, natural antioxidant in oil, oil extraction process, storage conditions of oil, impurities in oil, production processes, oil and biodiesel clean-up process. Based on this work, it is recommended to improve/develop the software in terms of accuracy and precision for predicting the biodiesel properties or adopt experimentation to determine biofuel properties. © 2021, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

AB  - In the automotive sector, price of petroleum products and its increasing demand needs a substitute to meet the energy requirements. Due to fuel lean operation, direct injection diesel engines are commonly used, when compared to spark ignition engine. For DI diesel engine, commercial fuel (diesel) is the major fuel source. However, the demand of petroleum based fuel increases one side and on other side there is rapid depletion of fossil fuels. Extensive research are being made to pursuit for an alternate fuel to avoid fossil fuel dependence. Biofuels are manufactured from both edible (sunflower, palm & peanut oil) and non-edible (jatropha oil, mahua oil, pongamia oil) feedstocks. The motivation of this work is to investigate the performance of biofuel from mahua seed oil and waste plastic oil on diesel engine. The advantage of non -edible biofuels compared to edible biofuels is that it doesn’t compete with the foodstuff and freely available in forest. Energy recovery from waste plastics reduces the pollution and encouraging technique for waste management. The amount of hydrocarbon is rich in plastics which produce high calorific oil which can be used as a fuel with some additives. The literature study concludes that plastic oil derived from waste plastic as an alternate liquid fuel for diesel engine is probable. © 2021, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.

AB  - The dependence of oil and its consequent commercial fluctuation make researchers to seek viable alternatives for their gradual replacement. The present work aims to evaluate the production of biofuels from the slow pyrolysis of the Syzygium malaccense biomass (Malay Apple) through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-DTG), Fraser-Suzuki deconvolution and chemometric tools of multivariate analysis. Three chemical treatments (sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid) were evaluated, as well as the variation in the heating rate and the consequent effects on the pyrolysis of biomass for the production of biofuels, totaling 16 pyrolysis routes (including the use of biomass no treatment). In the obtained data, multivariate analysis tools were used, looking for groups that presented favorable characteristics for the production of quality biofuels. Heatmap, k-means and SOM analysis indicated the routes that use phosphoric acid treatment and heating rates of 10 or 15 °C/min (Jap10 and Jap15, respectively) as relevant, because they have low lignin contents and high gaseous cellulose and hemicellulose contents. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Currently, the world is facing an energy crisis due to an increase in the global energy demand and this has led to an increased dependence on fossil fuels for energy generation and transportation. The steady rise in the world population which is more than seven billion currently is met with an increase in fossil fuel consumption thereby increasing the threat of fossil depletion and an apparent energy deficit. Fossil fuel emissions pose a threat to the environment and the general human population due to risks posed by greenhouse gases they produce. Biodiesel is recognized as a suitable alternative to fossil fuels due to its biodegradable, renewable and environmentally friendly nature. Biodiesel sources are classified into first, second and third generation based on their origin and type of feedstocks used. There are fourth-generation feedstocks which are biologically man-made resources that are currently at the embryotic stage of research. This paper reviews the sustainability of using Jatropha curcas seeds and microalgae for the production of biodiesel. It highlights an evaluation of the oil yield, composition and performance of the biodiesel derived from both sources whilst assessing the viability of individual feedstocks in biodiesel production. Additionally, different methods of biodiesel production are also assessed. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In this study, the characteristics of bio-oil samples produced through slow pyrolysis of two different macroalgae, i.e. Azolla filiculoides and Ulva fasciata, at optimized conditions were determined and compared. METHODS: For this purpose, the effects of temperature (300-500 °C), carrier gas flow rate (0.2-0.8 L/min), and heating rate (10-20 °C/min) on the final bio-oil production were optimized using response surface methodology established by a central composite design. FINDINGS: The highest bio-oil yield from U. fasciata (34.29%) was obtained at the temperature of 500 °C, nitrogen flow rate of 0.2 L/min, and heating rate of 10 °C/min. As for A. filiculoides feedstock, the highest bio-oil yield (30.83%) was achieved at the temperature of 461 °C, nitrogen flow rate of 0.5 L/min, and heating rate of 20 °C/min. Both bio-oil samples contained saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. However, the average hydrocarbon chain length was relatively shorter in U. fasciata bio-oil (C4-C16) than in bio-oil from A. filiculoides (C6-C24). Although both bio-oils had almost identical heating values, the U. fasciata bio-oil showed more appropriate properties, i.e. lower viscosity and density. Furthermore, the energy recovery from U. fasciata pyrolysis was calculated as 56.6% which was almost 1.5 times higher than the energy recovery from A. filiculoides pyrolysis. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that U. fasciata bio-oil, with its superior characteristics, could be proposed as a promising candidate for application in diesel-based automotive industries. ©2021 GJESM.

AB  - The separation of ethanol, propanol, and butanol from aqueous solutions was studied using adsorption on bone char. Adsorption kinetics and thermodynamic parameters of this separation method were studied at different conditions of pH and temperature. Results showed that the maximum adsorption capacities of these bioalcohols were obtained at pH 6 and 20°C. An exothermic separation was identified, which can be mainly associated to hydrophobic interactions between bone char surface and bioalcohols. Binary adsorption studies were also performed using mixtures of these bioalcohols. An antagonistic adsorption was observed for all bioalcohols where the ethanol and propanol separation was significantly affected by butanol. A model based on an artificial neural network was proposed to correlate both single and binary adsorption isotherms of these bioalcohols with bone char. It was concluded that the bone char could be an interesting adsorbent for the sustainable separation and recovery of bioalcohols from fermentation broths, which are actually considered emerging liquid biofuels and relevant industrial chemicals. © 2021 Oslery Becerra-Pérez et al.

AB  - Background: With the gradual decrease in fossil energy, the development of alternatives to fossil energy has attracted more and more attention. Biodiesel is considered to be the most potent alternative to fossil energy, mainly due to its green, renewable, and biodegradable advantages. The stable, efficient and reusable catalysts are undoubtedly the most critical in the preparation of biodiesel. Among them, nanoporous carbon-based acidic materials are very important biodiesel catalysts. Objective: The latest advances of acidic nanoporous carbon catalysts in biodiesel production was reviewed. Methods: Biodiesel is mainly synthesized by esterification and transesterification. Due to the important role of nanoporous carbon-based acidic materials in the catalytic preparation of biodiesel, we focused on the synthesis, physical and chemical properties, catalytic performance and reusability. Results: Acidic catalytic materials have a good catalytic performance for high acid value feedstocks. However, the preparation of biodiesel with acid catalyst requires relatively strict reaction conditions. The application of nanoporous acidic carbon-based materials, due to the support of carbon-based framework, makes the catalyst exhibit good stability and unique pore structure, accelerates the reaction mass transfer speed, which in turn accelerated the reaction. Conclusion: Nanoporous carbon-based acidic catalysts have the advantages such as, suitable pore structure, high active sites, and high stability. In order to make these catalytic processes more efficient, environmentally friendly and low cost, developing new catalytic materials with high specific surface area, suitable pore size, high acid density, and excellent performance would be an important research direction for the future biodiesel catalysts. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - In this paper, sulfonic groups functionalized annealed bio-based carbon microspheres loaded polytetrafluoroethylene (A-BCMSs-SO3H@PTFE) fibers with high activity, high stability, and easy regeneration were successfully fabricated by a simple method using low-cost raw materials. The characterization results showed that the annealed biomass carbon microspheres derived from waste Camellia oleifera shells were evenly distributed on the polytetrafluoroethylene fibers and the sulfonic groups can be successfully loaded on the surface of annealed biomass carbon microspheres by room temperature sulfonation. Subsequently, the as-prepared A-BCMSs-SO3H@PTFE fibers were applied to the acid-catalyzed synthesis of liquid biofuel 5-ethoxymethylfurfural. The catalytic experiment results indicated that the annealing temperature and time during catalyst preparation have a significant effect on the activity and selectivity of A-BCMSs-SO3H@PTFE fibers. The results of catalytic reaction kinetics showed that the yield of 5-ethoxymethylfurfural can reach more than 60% after 72 h of acid-catalyzed reaction. The stability test showed that the as-prepared A-BCMSs-SO3H@PTFE fibers still maintained a stable acid catalytic activity after four recycles. © 2020 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable, clean-burning diesel replacement that can be used in existing diesel engines without modification. Biodiesel is among the nation’s first domestically developed and economically usable advanced biofuels. Throughout the field of biodiesel including FAME/FAGE diesel variants, the concentrations of close to around 20% conform to every requirement out from the existing fuel content guidelines. Larger blending ratios are essential for hydrotreated vegetable oil blends to lubricity enhancers. Of organic biobutanol blends, the suggested blending ratio is restricted to 10% or less to prevent high water content and low cetane content. Here, the presented survey intends to make a review of 65 papers that concerns with biodiesel blends. Accordingly, systematic analyses of the adopted techniques are carried out and presented briefly. In addition, the performances and related maximum achievements of each contribution are also portrayed in this survey. Moreover, the chronological assessment and various blends of biodiesel in the considered papers are reviewed in this work. Finally, the survey portrays numerous research problems and weaknesses that may be helpful for researchers to introduce prospective studies on biodiesel blends. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - The synthesis and characterization of Ni/mesoporous silica (Ni/MS) catalysts from Lapindo mud with various met-Al loading for the hydrocracking of waste cooking oil into biofuel has been conducted. The MS was synthesized by the hydrothermal method using CTAB as a template. The nickel-metal of 4, 6, and 8 wt% was loaded into the MS using salt precursors of Ni(NO3)2.6H2O via wet impregnation, produced the Ni(4)/MS, Ni(6)/MS, and Ni(8)/MS cat-Alysts, respectively. The materials produced were then characterized by X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Surface Area Analyzer (SAA), and Absorption Atomic Spectropho-Tometry (AAS). The catalytic activity test was carried out for hydrocracking of waste cooking oil and the resulted liquid product was analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that the specific surface area of Ni(4)/MS, Ni(6)/MS, and Ni(8)/MS catalysts are 63.08, 91.45, and 120.45 m2/g, respectively. The liquid products of the hydrocracking using Ni(4)/MS, Ni(6)/MS, and Ni(8)/MS catalysts were 80.57, 74.63, and 75.77 wt%, where the total biofuel produced was 55.46, 50.93, and 54.05 wt%, respectively. Based on these results, Ni(4)/MS material was successfully used as the most potent catalyst in the hydrocracking of waste cooking oil into the biofuel.

AB  - The dynamic development of transport in recent decades reflects the level of economic development in the world. The transport sector today is one of the main barriers to the achievement of the European Union's climate protection objectives. More and more restrictive legal regulations define permissible emission limits for the amounts of toxic substances emitted into the atmosphere. Numerical CO2modeling tools are one way to replace costly on-road testing. Driving cycles, which are an approximation of the vehicle's on-road operating conditions, are the basis of any vehicle approval procedure. The paper presents a computer tool that uses neural networks to simulate driving tests. Data obtained from tests on the Mercedes E350 chassis dynamometer were used for the construction of the neural model. All the collected operational parameters of the vehicle, which are the input data for the built model, were used to create simulation control runs for driving tests: Environmental Protection Agency, Supplemental Federal Test Procedure, Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule, Federal Test Procedure, New European Driving Cycle, Random Cycle Low, Random Cycle High, Mobile Air Conditioning Test Procedure, Common Artemis Driving Cycles, Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicle Test Procedure. Using the developed computer simulation tool, the impact on CO2emissions was analyzed in the context of driving tests of four types of fuels: Diesel, Fatty Acid Methyl Esters, rapeseed oil, butanol (butyl alcohol). As a result of the processing of this same computer tool, mass consumption of fuels and CO2emissions were analyzed in driving tests for the given analyzed vehicle. © 2021 MDPI AG.

AB  - In recent decades, the energy demand is ever increasing. Biomass energy is a viable option as an alternative due to reduced CO2 emissions and depletion of fossil fuels at a faster rate. Therefore, the substitution of non-renewable fossil resources by renewable biomass as a sustainable feedstock has been focused on researchers to develop useful green fuels and other platform chemicals such as biofuels, commodity chemicals, and new bio-based materials. For the conversion of sugars, several methodologies have been investigated through chemocatalysis from plant-derived biomass feedstocks. This review critically overviewed the latest advancement regarding reaction conditions, product yields, and selectivity on the conversion of C6-sugars into important chemicals like 5- hydroxymethylfurfural, levulinic acid, lactic acid, formic acid, glyceraldehyde, 1,3-dihydroxyacetone and furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid, etc. This review describes green chemistry principles includes the main reactions used to convert renewable biomass into industrially important products that are applicable as raw materials with emphasis on preparative organic synthesis. © 2021 Deuton-X Ltd.

AB  - The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuel as potential sources of transportation fuels, and for being both non-toxic and biodegradable. 5- Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) has been discovered to be a precursor for biofuel production and can be produced from biomass, which is readily available, renewable, and sustainable. Cellulose content in cassava peels is an opportunity to produce bio-based chemical products called 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. This study aims to determine the proper condition of glucose dehydration reaction of cassava peels hydrolysis. The optimum condition of dehydration reaction in this study was a glucose mass ratio: Deep eutectic solvent of 1:6 and a reaction temperature of 80 ᵒC and the highest yield of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural using deep eutectic solvents (DES) based on choline chloride/oxalic acid was 70.22% and using DES based on choline chloride/oxalic acid was 64.50% at 5.70% glucose initial concentration using 1.5% H2SO4 catalyst on hydrolysis reaction cellulose of cassava peels. Physicochemical properties of deep eutectic solvents (DES) were pH of 5.8, density of 1.1574 gr/cm3 and viscosity of 119.33 cP. The results in this study indicate that the addition of DES choline chloride/oxalic acid can increase the yield of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural obtained. © 2021 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.

AB  - The present review presents the most commonplace vegetable-based feedstock for biodiesel production. It focuses on biodiesel production with an emphasis on the most recent studies and innovations. Transesterification of plant oil or animal fat is the most common process for the production of biodiesel. Several techniques are utilized for this transesterification reaction, such as batch processes, ultrasonic, microwave and other methods. Many conditions are usually studied, including temperature, pressure, solvent and catalysis. Furthermore, we aim to provide an investigation of the different processes and technologies applicable to the production of second-generation biodiesel, with special attention paid to the development of innovative catalysts as well as new reactor concepts. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) provides a promising route for upgrading biomass-derived fatty acids to alkanes, which are potential biofuels (e.g. jet fuel (C8–C16) and diesel (C12–C22)) that could reduce our reliance on unsustainable fossil fuels. Currently, catalytic HDO, conducted over catalysts such as molybdenum disulfide, necessitates harsh operating conditions (&gt;300 °C) which is both environmentally and economically unsustainable and promotes unwanted side reactions, e.g. cracking, which compromises product selectivity. Accordingly, the development of novel catalysts, which enable efficient and sustainable HDO, under milder operating conditions, and their translation from lab bench to large-scale production are highly desired. This review discusses the recent development of heterogeneous catalysts for HDO (including reaction pathways, mechanisms, and side reactions) and explores design strategies for the development of new multifunctional catalysts with potential to enable future development of HDO processes under mild conditions. In particular, we consider the sequential cascade transformation of fatty acids into fatty alcohols (via hydrodeoxygenation) and then hydrocarbons (via dehydration and hydrogenation), which requires the coupling of different but complementary catalytic sites, as an attractive alternative mild HDO strategy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, low-grade crude palm oil (LGCPO) containing 13.81 wt.% free fatty acid (FFA) was used as raw material. This study aimed to investigate the effects of LGCPO preparation methods on biodiesel basic properties, easing environmental impacts from sulfur emissions, and getting to zero-sulfur biodiesel. Hence, hydrochloric acid, which is an effective and environmentally friendly homogeneous acid catalyst, was selected as the catalyst to reduce FFA in pretreatment and to produce green biodiesel. The results indicate that the use 0.25 wt.% of hydrochloric acid as a catalyst in biodiesel production could efficiently reduce the FFA content to a standard level (< 2.00 wt.%) at 0.56 wt.% (FFA conversion 95.95%). The final ester contents were 98.05 and 97.31 wt.% for washed esterified palm oil (EPO) and for rinsed EPO without washing, respectively. Consequently, hydrochloric acid is a suitable catalyst and could replace the conventional sulfuric acid in biodiesel production from low quality crude palm oil. This would reduce the environmental impacts, especially sulfur emissions. High FFA leads to soap formation in fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) saponification causing problems in phase separation and emulsion formation during the purification stage, so catalytic preprocessing is a necessity. © 2021, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment.

AB  - The catalytic conversion of palm oil was carried out over four zeolite catalysts—Y, ZSM-5, Y-ZSM-5 hybrid, and Y/ZSM-5 composite—to produce jet biofuel with high amount of alkanes and low amount of aromatic hydrocarbons. The zeolite Y-ZSM-5 hybrid catalyst was synthesized using crystalline zeolite Y as the seed for the growth of zeolite ZSM-5. Synthesized zeolite catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia, while the chemical compositions of the jet biofuel were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The conversion of palm oil over zeolite Y resulted in the highest yield (42 wt%) of jet biofuel: a high selectivity of jet range alkanes (51%) and a low selectivity of jet range aromatic hydrocarbons (25%). Zeolite Y-ZSM-5 hybrid catalyst produced a decreased percentage of jet range alkane (30%) and a significant increase in the selectivity of aromatic hydrocarbons (57%). The highest conversion of palm oil to hydrocarbon compounds was achieved by zeolite Y-ZSM-5 hybrid catalyst (99%), followed by zeolite Y/ZSM-5 composite (96%), zeolite Y (91%), and zeolite ZSM-5 (74%). The reaction routes for converting palm oil to jet biofuel involve deoxygenation of fatty acids into C15–C18 alkanes via decarboxylation and decarbonylation, catalytic cracking into C8–C14 alkanes, and cycloalkanes as well as aromatization into aromatic hydrocarbon. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Xylan, second most abundant natural polysaccharide after cellulose, has tremendous applications in various industrial processes. There are several xylan degrading catalysts available, but, still, there is continuous quest among the scientific community to search for new hyperactive xylanases. In the present study, the catalytic potential of xylanase from Bacillus sp. XPB-11 was improved using various mutagens. 5-Bromo-Uracil proved to be the best mutagen resulting in stable and hyperactive mutant BU-7 that showed maximum xylanase activity, i.e., 154.16 ± 2.23 U/mg protein. Further, optimizing the various parameters resulted in 20% enhancement and overall twofold increase in the xylanase activity of mutant, i.e.188.24 ± 1.80 U/mg protein. This hyperactive mutant released 26.8 ± 2.17 mg/ml of C-5 sugar from microwave + 0.5 N NaOH pretreated pine needle waste biomass that on fermentation using Kluyveromyces marxianus MTCC 1498 produced 5.34 g/l of bioethanol with 3.89% yield and 93.5% purity. The hyperactive xylanase from Bacillus sp. XPB-11 mutant BU-7, developed in the present study to release C-5 sugar from pine needle waste biomass and its subsequent biotransformation into bioethanol, is of commercial significance to utilize one of the problematic waste biomass from Himalayan Region for its conversion into second-generation biofuel i.e. bioethanol.

AB  - Biodiesel is a kind of biofuels that can be mixed with diesel and used as fuel. Selecting cheap and available feedstock is a prominent step in producing biodiesel economically. This paper presents the pros and cons of biodiesel and its production methods. The diesel demand is significantly high in Iran, especially in the transportation sector; On the other hand, the amount of produced waste is significant in chicken slaughterhouses. Considering this type of feedstock as a source to produce biodiesel not only can reduce the associated environmental problems, but also can supply some of the diesel needs. Hence, this paper also estimates biodiesel production potential from poultry slaughter waste and its cost. Based on the results, 736 kilotonnes of poultry slaughter waste is produced annually in Iran, which can be used as feedstock to produce 112 million liters of biodiesel by transesterification process with the production cost of around 14,277 rial/liter; i.e. 30% of diesel demand in the transportation sector can be supplied by B2 (98% diesel and 2% biodiesel) or diesel demand growth in this sector converted to B20 to increase economical and environmental sustainability. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - To date, heavy metals present a main drawback for bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) performances. Therefore, our results confirm, for the first time, that Hansenulafabianii is an electrochemical active yeast that has a potential tolerance against various heavy metals. The bioreactor inoculated by Hansenula fabianii in mediatoless conditions provided a maximum current density of 32 mA/m2; up to 300 mA/m2 in the presence of methylene blue. In mediatorless conditions, cyclic voltammetry (CV) on a yeast pellet showed a single oxidative peak at 450mV and a pair peak, the CV of the supernatant confirmed that Hansenula fabianii secretedits own mediator. The obtained results proved that Hansenula fabianii based biofuel cell could be used for simultaneous current generation and heavy metal bioremediation. © 2021. The Authors.

AB  - The rapidly growing energy demand across the globe and emission problem can be compensated by biodiesel blends. These promising renewable fuels can be developed from vegetable feedstock. The influences of biodiesel blend (B10) derived from inedible vegetable oil were explored on combustion as well as performance along with emission parameters at different percentage of loading conditions in a normally aspirated with liquid cooled, single-cylinder, direct-injection compression ignition (CI) engine. A combined method of acid catalyst esterification followed by alkali catalyst transesterification is used to prepare biodiesel. Using conventional procedures the important properties of biodiesel have been tested for its important requirement as engine fuel. A compression ignition, single-zone biodiesel engine model has been established based on engine geometries (stroke, cylinder diameter, con rod length, and diameter of crank). Deviation in specific heat ratio of engine cylinder charge and burnt gases has been established. The predicted model for biodiesel blend engine has been verified using diesel and biodiesel blends B10. The event of reduced cylinder peak pressure and poor engine performance along with slight reduction in NOx emission while fuelled with NOME and WVOME blend (B10) are examined in this study. NOME B10 is preferred over WVOME B10 as an alternative to petroleum diesel. In order to find out the performance results and combustion nature, constant engine speed (1500 rpm) is being maintained during the experiments under 0%, 25%, 50%, and 100% load condition. © 2021 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - Jatropha is considered as one of the most promising potential oil sources for biodiesel production and other industrial applications. However, research on the potential of Jatropha seed oil is mainly focused on Jatropha curcas, with other species receiving little attention. The physicochemical properties of J. podagrica seed oil was studied to determine its potential as feedstock for biodiesel production and other industrial applications in Thailand. The seed oil was extracted with n-hexane from milled kernels using the soxhlet extractor and subsequently characterised for free fatty acids, iodine value, viscosity, saponification value, density, and acid value. The fatty acid profile of the seed oil was also analysed using gas chromatography (GC). Analysis of the physical properties of the J. podagrica seed kernel showed lower average physical characteristics when compared to those of J. curcas seed kernel. J. podagrica seeds had high oil content comparable to J. curcas oil content. The main fatty acid components of the seed oil were oleic acid (15%) and linoleic acid (70%). Generally, the results of the physicochemical analysis indicated that J. podagrica seed oil would be very useful for the production of soap and shampoo in Thailand. To produce biodiesel from the seed oil, a two-step acid-catalysed transesterification process would be appropriate. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel was produced from waste coffee grounds (WCGs) using solid catalysts manufactured from waste scallop shells through a one-step direct process (OSDP) comprising lipid extraction and simultaneous transesterification in a reactor. To facilitate the reuse of the solid catalysts, a cartridge containing the solid catalysts was devised, and the optimal conditions of the OSDP with the cartridge were investigated. Agitation speed was a critical factor for the operation of this novel process, and should be at least 200 rpm. The optimal total volume of the mixture consisting of methanol and n-hexane (9 mL/g-WCGs) was determined, along with the volume fraction of methanol (18.0%) and n-hexane (82.0%) using a statistical Mixture-Design technique. The optimum catalyst concentration (5.0 wt%), temperature (50°C), and reaction time (13 h) were determined through a Full Factorial Design, followed by a One-Factor-at-a-Time technique. Under these optimum conditions, 8.7% of biodiesel yield was obtained. The concentration of solid catalysts in the cartridge significantly influenced the reuse number of the cartridge. The cartridge containing 5.0 wt% of solid catalysts was reused only for the 2nd round of operation, while that containing 100 wt% of solid catalysts was successfully reused until the 12th round of operation, without a noticeable decrease in biodiesel yield. © 2021, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer.

AB  - A high-oil candlenut (Aleurites moluccana)-derived biodiesel was purified using new generation solvents called Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and physicochemical properties of the purified biodiesel were assessed according to the accepted international standards for biodiesel (ASTM D6751; EN 14214). Binary and ternary choline chloride-based DESs containing glycerol and ethylene glycol as hydrogen bond donors were synthesized. The results of the investigation showed that the quality of DESs-purified biodiesel generally improved compared with the unpurified biodiesel and fulfilled the accepted standard limits for biodiesel except carbon residue and oxidation stability properties. Choline chloride/ethylene glycol (ChCl/ Eg, 1:2 molar ratio) having a DES/biodiesel ratio of 1:1 (DES2-11) has enhanced the Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) content of unpurified biodiesel from 81.89% to 98.13%, and the oxidation stability from 2.36 h to 3.06 h. 1H NMR examination showed the successful synthesis of DESs; GC-MS analysis of candlenut oil and its biodiesel revealed oil and fatty acid methyl ester compositions, respectively. The similarity in FAME compositions between DESs-purified and unpurified biodiesel as revealed through GC-MS examination suggests the selective removal of impurities and the efficiency of DESs in improving the quality of candlenut-derived biodiesel. © 2021 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Synthesis of 1,3- dioxane and 1,3-dioxolane, using sulfated CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst for acetalization of glycerol with benzaldehyde, is the focus of present work. SO42-/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst was synthesized using combustion method. Experiments were carried out to analyze the effect of various solvents (n-hexane, toluene, tert-butyl alcohol, pentanol), molar ratios (1:3, 1:5, 1:7), catalyst loadings (3 wt%, 5 wt%, 9 wt %) and temperatures (80 °C, 90 °C, 100 °C) on glycerol conversion and selectivity of the products. Selectivity of 87.20% dioxolane and 12.80% dioxane was obtained at molar ratio of 1:3, 9 wt% catalyst loading and temperature of 100 °C.Strong NH3 desorption peak from NH3-TPD study indicated the high acidic strength of sulphated catalyst. Strong surface acidity and surface porosity (observed from TEM and SEM analysis) contributed to an enhanced activity of the catalyst for glycerol acetalization reaction. The kinetics of the reaction was studied using an elementary kinetic law. A correlation coefficient of 0.98 from the selected kinetic model proved that the rate of acetalization reaction was dependent on glycerol concentration and acetal formation was instantaneous. The study demonstrated the application of an environmentally benign, inexpensive, thermally stable, active SO42-/CeO2–ZrO2 catalyst for glycerol acetalization reaction to synthesize 1,3-dioxolane as the desired product. © 2021

AB  - Low biodegradability caused by polymeric structure is the main barrier in the use of lignocellulosic materials in biofuels production by using biological methods. Pretreatment of the biomass is the way to improve the suitability of hardly biodegradable biomass for biogas or bioethanol production. Evaluation of the influence of thermal and thermochemical alkaline pretreatment on the efficiency of hydrolysis of hay (mixture of various grass species) was the aim of the study. The batch scale experiment was carried out with the use of NaOH and distilled water as solvents, and the changes in pretreatment time (2, 4 and 8 hours) and temperature (22 and 80ºC) were also consid-ered. The efficiency of biomass solubilisation was assessed based on the results obtained from the measurements of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration in the hydrolysates. The solubility of the biomass, expressed as a percentage of soluble COD in total COD, was calculated. The experiment showed that the highest solubilisation of hay biomass was observed at 80ºC under alkaline conditions. In this case, the solubility of the COD was 3-times higher, and the VFA concentration in hydrolysates was 4-times higher in comparison to the distilled water-based test at 22ºC. It was noted that time of the process significantly influenced the efficiency of biomass solubilisation only during the experiment carried out at 22ºC. Extension of hydrolysis time from 2 to 8 hours increased the value of soluble COD of 70% and 55% for water and alkaline solvent, respectively. The process conducted at 80ºC was not time-dependent over the considered period. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - During the poultry industrialization process the so-called sludge oil, a residual chicken fat, is recovered in the wastewater treatment plant and its use presents potential as raw material for biodiesel production. Thus, the aim of the study was to prepare blends of sludge oil with soybean oil to obtain fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) through the homogeneous alkaline transesterification reaction. To perform this study, a simple pre-treatment process–heating and subsequent filtration–was used, allowing sludge oil to be mixed with soybean oil to compose blends, without the need to use more sophisticated pre-treatment processes. After this step, blends ranging from 5% to 90% (m/m) of sludge oil mixed with soybean oil were prepared. The results showed that the molar ratio (1:6 oil blend:methanol), catalyst concentration 0.5% NaOH (mcat/moil), at 65 °C for 60 min yielded FAME above 99.0 and 90.0% (m/m) for blends with up to 5 and 15% sludge oil, respectively. By increasing the temperature to 70 °C, under the same selected parameters, the blend with 10% sludge oil provided yield above 99.0% (m/m), presenting appropriate physicochemical properties, within the parameters required by National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP). These findings show the great potential sludge oil provides to reduce Brazil’s dependency on soybean oil for biodiesel production. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this paper, a novel mathematical model that combines a membrane filtration model, component balances and reaction kinetics models for an intensified separation-reaction process in membrane reactor producing biofuels was developed. A unique feature is that the proposed model can capture the dynamics of membrane fouling as function of both reversible and irreversible fouling; which leads to cyclic behavior. Fouling leads to the decline of the reactor productivity. With an appropriate fouling-model, the operational strategy can be optimized. In the case study of biodiesel production, the developed model was validated with experimental data. The model was in good agreement with the data, where R-squared are 0.96 for the permeate flux and 0.95 for the biodiesel yield. From a further analysis, the efficiency of membrane reaction system in term of productivity can be significantly improved by changing the backwashing frequency under specific operating conditions. As the backwashing frequency increased eight times, the biodiesel yield increased to more than two to three times before the permeate flux dropped under a predetermined limit due to the increase of irreversible membrane fouling. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) have excellent potential as components in bioelectronic devices, especially as active biointerfaces to regulate stem cell behavior for regenerative medicine applications. However, it remains unclear to what extent EBFC-generated electrical stimulation can regulate the functional behavior of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAD-MSCs) at the morphological and gene expression levels. Herein, we investigated the effect of EBFC-generated electrical stimulation on hAD-MSC cell morphology and gene expression using next-generation RNA sequencing. We tested three different electrical currents, 127 ± 9, 248 ± 15, and 598 ± 75 nA/cm2, in mesenchymal stem cells. We performed transcriptome profiling to analyze the impact of EBFC-derived electrical current on gene expression using next generation sequencing (NGS). We also observed changes in cytoskeleton arrangement and analyzed gene expression that depends on the electrical stimulation. The electrical stimulation of EBFC changes cell morphology through cytoskeleton re-arrangement. In particular, the results of whole transcriptome NGS showed that specific gene clusters were up-or down-regulated depending on the magnitude of applied electrical current of EBFC. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that EBFC-generated electrical stimulation can influence the morphological and gene expression properties of stem cells; such capabilities can be useful for regenerative medicine applications such as bioelectronic devices. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Liquid biofuels have emerged as a worldwide alternative fuel with potential to replace fossil fuels. Due to their wide availability as derivatives of organic materials from plants, they have attracted much attention and investment in developing countries including Tanzania, as alternative sources of energy. This study examined effects of oil quality from stem barks and phylloclades of Euphorbia tirucalli trees of different girth sizes (viz., 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm, 50 cm, 60 cm, 70 cm, and 80 cm) from semi-arid, coastal, and southern highlands in Dodoma, Dar es Salaam, and Mbeya Southern highland, agro-ecological zones in Tanzania. Using Soxhlet extraction method, oils were extracted from E. tirucalli stem barks with different girth sizes while oils from phylloclades were extracted from matured apical phylloclades collected from shoots of E. tirucalli trees from which the stem bark samples had been collected. Oil yields were determined by measuring the weight of oil (g) by the total weight of sample extracts used (20 g), and the average oil yield on each sample was determined. Oil quality was evaluated as oxidative stability index (OSI), acid values (AVs), and percent free fatty acids (%FFAs). Their results were then compared with the European Union (EU) oil quality standard specifications prescribed in EN 14214 of 6 h, 0.5 mg KOH/g, max and 0.020 maximum wt% limits, respectively. Differences in the quality of E. tirucalli (stem bark and phylloclades) oil were analyzed statistically with paired-sample t test (two-tailed) using the SPSS 15.0 software package. Results showed that the difference in OSIs from stem barks were not significantly higher (3–5 h) than phylloclades (3–4 h) at the p > 0.5 level. Also, the difference in AVs and %FFAs from the stem barks (7.6–7.4 mg KOH and 3.8–3.6%) was not significantly lower than those from the phylloclades (8.4–8.1 mg KOH and 4.3–4.0%) respectively. The quality of oil from stem bark and phylloclades samples at different stem girth sizes semi-arid agro-ecological zone was not significantly higher than from southern highland and coastal agro-ecological zones, respectively. Thus, there were no significant differences in the quality of E. tirucalli oil (stem bark and phylloclades) among stem girth sizes in different agro-ecological zones. The AVs and %FFAs of oils from stem bark and phylloclades were higher than the recommended standards, while the OSIs were below the biofuel standard limit. High AVs and %FFAs reduced oil quality by producing considerably low OSIs values than recommended standards. Finally, the study concluded that E. tirucalli oil requires purification to reduce levels of AV and %FFA contents so that the oil becomes suitable for application as liquid biofuel for energy generations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The cost of biodiesel production and the requirement of raw ingredients are the primary constraints that need to be addressed while searching for viable alternative fuels to petrol and diesel. Oleaginous yeasts are gaining wider acceptance as biofuel candidates among oil-rich crops/microbes. The present investigation aimed to integrate the agro-industrial wastewater stream as a nutrient source for the cultivation of oleaginous yeast and to use the resultant biomass and lipid as a feedstock for biofuel synthesis. The yeast biomass grown in sago processing wastewater contained 7.21% moisture content, 69.01% volatile matter, 12.61% fixed carbon, and 11.16% ash content. The ultimate analysis determined the contents of carbon (40.43%), nitrogen (5.14%), hydrogen (4.62%), sulfur (0.54%), and oxygen (49.27%). The heating value of yeast biomass was 16.54 MJ kg−1. The thermal behavior of yeast biomass also suggests its potential use as an energy source. The FTIR spectrum of biomass had major lipid (3030–2800 cm−1 and 1500–1350 cm−1) and carbohydrate (1250 cm−1 and 1000 cm−1) functional peaks. Further FAME profiling revealed that the yeast biomass is primarily composed of stearic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids, similar to the vegetable oils. The fuel characteristics of yeast biodiesel (SV, 168.87 mg KOH g−1; IV, 120 mg I2 100 g−1; CN, 61.79; and KV, 3.16 mm2 s−1) are also within the ASTM standard limits, suggesting that yeast biomass could be a sustainable and economically viable feedstock for both solid and liquid biofuel production. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The increasing global energy demand, scarcity of fossil fuels, and climate change have encouraged the use of renewable energy sources to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels and reduce the environmental impacts. Liquid biofuels have received noticeable attention lately as renewable feedstock for hydrogen production. Since the ever-growing production of biodiesel leads to an accumulated surplus of glycerol in the world market with a low commercial value, research is focused on finding alternative methods to make use of glycerol with the aim of upgrading the biodiesel business and improving its economic feasibility. The main objective of the current study is to perform a parametric analysis and optimization of bio-hydrogen production via steam reforming of the glycerol and biodiesel mixtures. A simulation model for steam reforming of glycerol/biodiesel mixture was developed using Aspen Plus software. The simulation results were validated with experimental data. The comparison showed a good agreement between the simulation and experimental results. A parametric study was carried out to investigate the effects of the gasification temperature (500–800 °C), steam-to-fuel ratio (SFR) (6–12), and biodiesel-to-glycerol ratio (BGR) (0–20%) on the composition of the syngas fuel. The response surface methodology (RSM) with conjunction of central composite design (CCD) was used in this study to optimize the steam fuel reforming process. The simulation results showed that the reformer temperature was found to significantly affect hydrogen production compared to the SFR and BGR. A quadratic equation developed in this study for the hydrogen versus the three input factors (temperature, SFR, BGR) fits very well with the predicted value obtained from the simulation (R2 = 0.99). The optimized operating conditions of the reformer for maximum bio-hydrogen production (66.06 mol%) are as follows: reformer temperature of 689.27 °C, SFR of 9.87, and BGR of 5.63%. This research study brings clear evidence for the research community as well as industry that bio-hydrogen can be successfully produced via steam reforming of glycerol and biodiesel mixtures.

AB  - In this study, Albizia saman bark hydrochar (ASB-HC) as a solid biofuel was generated by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). Response surface methodology (RSM) identified the importance of variables and their interactions to conduct the experiments. The effects of the reaction temperature (180–200 °C), residence time (2–4 h), and stirring speed (400–600 rpm) on ASB-HC yield (wt. %) and higher heating value (HHV) were analyzed and optimized for these factors and responses using the Box–Behnken design (BBD) of RSM. FTIR, TGA, SEM-EDX, and HHV analyses were done to characterize and understand the effects of HTC on Albizia saman bark (ASB-raw) and ASB-HC in an optimized state. In this optimized state, the carbonization temperature, residence time, and stirring speed were 180 °C, 4 h, and 600 rpm, respectively, with 69.89% yield and 18.59 MJ/kg HHV. The influence of temperature on hydrochar production compared to the time and stirring speed was evident in the investigation. The HHV of ASB-raw was 15.8 MJ/kg which increased to 18.59 MJ/kg at ASB-HC. The proximate and ultimate analysis revealed that ASB-HC had higher fixed carbon but there was less oxygen and volatile matter content than ASB-raw. The obtained activation energy indicated the slower reaction rate of hydrochar degradation. This investigation provides practical insights about hydrochar properties, process conditions, and thermal degradation kinetics on hydrothermal treatment for bark feedstock.

AB  - The aim of the study was to produce biodiesel from animal oil as non-edible feedstock. Three different concentrations of oils were used to produce the biodiesel. The main characteristic of these oils was high-free fatty acid content. The oils were transesterified with acid and basic catalysts, respectively. Biodiesel yield of 90 wt.% was obtained by acid transesterification (9 wt.% HCl, 6:1 methanol: oil molar ratio, 60°C, 46 h). Pre-esterification conditions were studied using different oils and acid catalysts: 0.6 wt.% HCl, 6:1 methanol: oil molar ratio at 60°C for 4 h, and this resulted in oil with an acid value of less than 0.8%. Under similar transesterification conditions, alkali transesterification of esterified fats resulted in the yield of 97.2 wt.% esters. Biodiesel properties were determined and most of the properties were within EN 14214 and ASTM D6751. Biodiesel from animal fats is less stable for oxidation and this is due to the absence of natural antioxidants as compared to the biodiesel of vegetable origin. For this reason, biodiesel produced from animal fats might not be adequate to use at 100% pure in vehicles during cold weather. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The municipal and agricultural wastes are promising source of ligniocellulosic biomasses (LBs) for bioethanol production. However, the pretreatment-hydrolysis (P–H) of LB is the most difficult process in bioethanol production due to high crystallinity of LB compositional structures. In this study, p-toluenesulphonic acid (PTSA) was investigated for P–H of multi-substrate (MS) sample of LBs. Five alternative MS samples were prepared from 10 single LBs. Based on the total reducing sugar yield, one of the MS was selected for optimization experiment. The factors affecting P–H (acid concentration, time and temperature) were optimized to compare catalytic activity of PTSA and H2SO4. Under the optimized conditions, maximum total reducing sugar (TRS) yield of 95.89 and 78.26% was obtained using PTSA and H2SO4, respectively. Mass production of hydrolysate was carried out using both catalysts at a substrate load of 50 g.L−1 and fermented at an optimum yeast load of 10% (v/v). The ethanol yield from the hydrolysates of PTSA treatment was 16.89 g L−1 (74.5%) and from H2SO4 was 13.17 g L−1 (70.9%) at 48 &amp; 56 h fermentation time, respectively. The PTSA surpassed the conventional method of treatment (H2SO4) both in TRS and ethanol yield. The efficiency of PTSA can be noticed in that one third of the acid concentration required in sulfuric acid treatment was used in PTSA to obtain 96% of TRS at lower temperature. This study revealed the potential of aqueous PTSA for the hydrolysis of a mixture of feedstocks which is much more complex and challenging than treating a single substrate. © 2020

AB  - Large quantities of waste cooking oils (WCO) are generated annually, as a result of food preparation, which can cause contamination of waters and soils, if they are not disposed of properly, but in turn have great potential in the production of biodiesel. In this work, the WCO collected from fast food establishments were subjected to an esterification pretreatment, varying the reaction conditions, molar ratio, catalyst concentration and time, to decrease the content of free fatty acids generated in the frying processes; after an alkaline transesterification. The initial acidity of the WCO (10,08 ± 0,22 %) was found to drop below 1 % during esterification at 60 °C and 100 rpm, with RMAVU:MeOH of 1: 7 and HCl concentration of 0.3 %v/v, with a conversion of free fatty acids (FFA) to methyl esters of 94.48 and 98.61 % for reaction times of 4 and 6 hours, respectively. The previously esterified WCO were subjected to a transesterification process with KOH as a catalyst in the presence of methanol, at 60 °C and 100 rpm, finding that the biodiesel produced was a mixture composed of the methyl esters of linoleic acids (57 %), palmitic (14 %), oleic (22 %), stearic (4 %) and elaidic (3 %). The highest concentration of methyl esters (93,797 ± 0.685 g.L-1) was obtained when using the esterified AVU during 6 hours of reaction. FTIR spectra confirmed the conversion of fatty acids to methyl esters, so this product could be used as a biofuel. © 2021, Universidad del Zulia. All rights reserved.

AB  - The oil industry needs to reduce CO2 emissions across the entire lifecycle of fossil fuels to meet environmental regulations and societal requirements and to sustain its business. With this goal in mind, this study aims to evaluate the CO2 mitigation potential of several bio-oil co-processing pathways in an oil refinery. Techno-economic analysis was conducted on different pathways and their greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potentials were compared. Thirteen pathways with different bio-oils, including vegetable oil (VO), fast pyrolysis oil (FPO), hydro-deoxygenated oil (HDO), catalytic pyrolysis oil (CPO), hydrothermal liquefaction oil (HTLO), and Fischer–Tropsch fuels, were analyzed. However, no single pathway could be presented as the best option. This would depend on the criteria used and the target of the co-processing route. The results obtained indicated that up to 15% of the fossil-fuel output in the refinery could be replaced by biofuel without major changes in the core activities of the refinery. The consequent reduction in CO2 emissions varied from 33% to 84% when compared with pure equivalent fossil fuels replaced (i.e., gasoline and diesel). Meanwhile, the production costs varied from 17 to 31€/GJ (i.e., 118–213$/bbleq). Co-processing with VO resulted in the lowest overall performance among the options that were evaluated while co-processing HTLO in the hydrotreatment unit and FPO in the fluid catalytic cracking unit showed the highest potential for CO2 avoidance (69% of refinery CO2 emissions) and reduction in CO2 emissions (84% compared to fossil fuel), respectively. The cost of CO2 emissions avoided for all of the assessed routes was in the range of €99–651 per tCO2. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The development of a new kind of material that is a nanostructured catalytic material with an environmentally benign nature that can be used for alternative energy has acquired significance in recent years. The use of heterogeneous catalysts for the transesterification of vegetable oils has gained prominence due to their eco-friendly and reusable nature. Pure hydroxyapatite (HAp) and hydroxyapatite/platinum (HAp/Pt) nanostructured particles were prepared through a facile chemical method without templates and surfactants and their catalytic activity investigated for transesterification of natural vegetable oil to bioenergy (biodiesel). The textural and structural features of pure HAp and HAp/Pt were evaluated using FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The elements present in the prepared nanostructures were confirmed through energy dispersive spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. The XPS analysis confirmed the metallic nature of the platinum in HAp/Pt. The specific surface area and porous nature of the prepared nanostructured catalysts were studied using the N2 physisorption Brunauer-Emmett-Teller-Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method. The catalytic activity of the pure HAp nanoparticles and HAp/Pt core shell nanorods with the Simarouba glauca plant seed oil was studied. The obtained results indicated that the pristine HAp nanoparticles and HAp/Pt core shell nanorods (NR) show 91.4% and 87.1% fatty acid methyl ester conversion, respectively, potentially offering environmental benign biocatalysts for biofuel production from natural feed stock.

AB  - Enhancement of the transesterification efficiency of triglyceride has come under heated study in biodiesel-making industry. In this research, the NiMo/La-Al2O3 nanopowders have been prepared for producing biodiesel efficiently. The screening test showed that the NiMo/La-Al2O3 catalyst has the best catalytic activity for triglyceride transesterification. Besides, the process parameters including reaction temperature, time, oil-to-alcohol ratio and catalyst loading etc., also have been investigated for optimization of the transesterification process. The results showed that with 5 wt% of catalyst loading, and oil to methanol molar ratio of 1:9, the conversion yield of triglyceride could be up to 95.2% within 120 min at 160°C. The NiMo/La-Al2O3 catalyst has the outstanding recycle property, which proved that the prepared NiMo/La-Al2O3 powders can be suitable for biodiesels’ production. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - γ-Valerolactone (GVL) is a versatile biomass-derived molecule for both value-added chemicals and biofuels, which is typically prepared from levulinates over metal particles or oxides in the presence of hydrogen, formic acid or alcohol. Herein, we reported a rapid and mild approach for cascade hydrogenation-cyclization of ethyl levulinate (EL) to GVL in the presence of readily available ionic liquid tetrabutylammonium fluoride ([TBA]F) and polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) as catalyst and hydrogen source, respectively. After reacting at room temperature for 30 min, a high GVL yield of 85% with TOF value of 52 h−1 could be obtained over 3 mol% [TBA]F. In addition to optimizing reaction parameters, the catalytic mechanism was also elucidated for the one-pot sequential transformation of EL to GVL. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A sustainable bio-based fuel industry is dependent on finding efficient technologies for the production of biofuels. A microwave-assisted method to produce bio-butanol from bio-ethanol in liquid phase was investigated using a 2-level factorial design with catalyst type and loading, reaction temperature and reaction time as variables. A combined severity factor (CSF) was used to quantify the combined effect of all reaction conditions on ethanol conversion and butanol selectivity. From the results, it could be qualitatively deduced that the reaction initially followed the Guerbet mechanism for formation of butanol, but gradually shifted toward the direct coupling mechanism as reaction conditions became more severe with 50% of the butanol produced at a CSF of 6, produced through the direct coupling mechanism. The overall reaction order and observed specific reaction rate was determined as 1.54 ± 0.26 and 2.91·10−6 ± 2.36·10−7 g.0.54.L−0.54.s−1 respectively. Both high ethanol conversions (76.6 wt%) and high butanol selectivity (60 wt%) could be obtained in a very short reaction time (60 minutes). The results represent an improvement in reaction time, ethanol conversion and butanol selectivity of 300%, 47% and 16.7% respectively compared to previously reported data. This represents a significant step towards realizing an affordable low-carbon drop-in fuel for a low carbon economy. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Sustainable lignocellulosic spent waste rice straw (SWRS) from bioethanol production inventively applied in this study to valorize petroleum production produced water (PPPW). SWRS expressed efficient pollutant removal over a wide range of petroleum concentration, temperature, pH, salinity, and mixing rate reaching approximately 217 mg/g, within four hours contact time. Kinetic studies revealed a pseudo-second-order chemisorption process with a boundary layer control and 16.97 kJ/mol activation energy where the intra-particle diffusion was not the only rate regulatory step. Thermodynamic studies revealed spontaneous, favorable, and endothermic adsorption, with a strong affinity between the SWRS and oil molecules. Biosorption mechanism studies proved the enrollment of SWRS components’ lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose in the oil uptake with the predominance of chemisorption over physisorption onto the rough and highly porous SWRS surface. A single-stage batch biosorption process was designed based on the best fitted Langmuir adsorption isotherm and applied on a real PPPW sample. The Egyptian standard limits for safe industrial effluents discharge into marine environment with a concomitant decrease in scale formation precursors were achieved recommending its safe reuse for enhanced oil recovery. Finally, for accomplishing zero-waste, SWRS disposed of PPPW treatment substantiated valorized solid biofuel with a sufficient calorific value 38.56 MJ/kg. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Conventional thermochemical conversion techniques for biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass is often non-selective and energy inefficient. Microwave assisted pyrolysis (MAP) is cost and energy-efficient technology aimed for value-added bioproducts recovery from biomass with less environmental impacts. The present review emphasizes the performance of MAP in terms of product yield, characteristics and energy consumption and further it compares it with conventional pyrolysis. The significant role of biochar as catalyst in microwave pyrolysis for enhancing the product selectivity and quality, and the influence of microwave activation on product composition identified through sophisticated techniques has been highlighted. Besides, the application of MAP based biochar as soil conditioner and heavy metal immobilization has been illustrated. MAP accomplished at low temperature creates uniform thermal gradient than conventional mode, thereby producing engineered char with hotspots that could be used as catalysts for gasification, energy storage, etc. The stability, nutrient content, surface properties and adsorption capacity of biochar was enhanced by microwave activation, thus facilitating its use as soil conditioner. Many reviews until now on MAP mostly dealt with operational conditions and product yield with limited focus on comparative energy consumption with conventional mode, analytical techniques for product characterization and end application especially concerning agriculture. Thus, the present review adds on to the current state of art on microwave assisted pyrolysis covering all-round aspects of production followed by characterization and applications as soil amendment for increasing crop productivity in addition to the production of value-added chemicals, thus promoting process sustainability in energy and environment nexus. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of time (10–60 min) and temperature (250–350°C) on TOCcrude and biochar yields from coir and pith through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process was investigated. The parameters were optimized for minimum biochar and maximum total organic carbon (TOC) in aqueous crude using response surface methodology (RSM). The optimal time and temperature for HTL of coir and pith were 35 min, 302°C, and 35.2 min, 300°C, respectively. Higher biomass conversion and bio-oil yield of 87.34%, 83.76% and 34.6%, 32.72%, was observed for coir and pith, respectively. The biochar yield for coir and pith was reduced from 40 to 12.66% and 34–16.24%. The oxygen and carbon content in the HTL products such as heavy bio-oil (HBO), light bio-oil (LBO) were lower and higher increasing the High Heating Value (HHV), respectively. The HHV of HBO, and LBO for coir and pith were 31 MJ/kg, 22 MJ/kg and 28 MJ/kg, 19 MJ/kg, respectively. The GC-MS/MS analysis revealed that the oil was a mixture of compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, amines, amides, esters, ethers, phenols, and their derivatives. Therefore, the conversion of coir and pith to bio-oil can be effectively achieved through the HTL process. © 2021

AB  - Background: Oleaginous filamentous fungi can accumulate large amount of cellular lipids and potentially serve as a major source of oleochemicals for food, feed, chemical, pharmaceutical, and transport industries. Transesterification of microbial oils is an essential step in microbial lipid production at both laboratory and industrial scale. Direct transesterification can considerably reduce costs, increase sample throughput and improve lipid yields (in particular fatty acid methyl esters, FAMEs). There is a need for the assessment of the direct transesterification methods on a biomass of filamentous fungi due to their unique properties, specifically resilient cell wall and wide range of lipid content and composition. In this study we have evaluated and optimised three common direct transesterification methods and assessed their suitability for processing of fungal biomass. Results: The methods, based on hydrochloric acid (Lewis method), sulphuric acid (Wahlen method), and acetyl chloride (Lepage method), were evaluated on six different strains of Mucoromycota fungi by using different internal standards for gas chromatography measurements. Moreover, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used for the detection of residual lipids in the biomass after the transesterification reaction/extraction, while transesterification efficiency was evaluated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results show that the majority of lipids, in particular triglycerides, were extracted for all methods, though several methods had substandard transesterification yields. Lewis method, optimised with respect to solvent to co-solvent ratio and reaction time, as well as Lepage method, offer precise estimate of FAME-based lipids in fungal biomass. Conclusions: The results show that Lepage and Lewis methods are suitable for lipid analysis of oleaginous filamentous fungi. The significant difference in lipid yields results, obtained by optimised and standard Lewis methods, indicates that some of the previously reported lipid yields for oleaginous filamentous fungi must be corrected upwards. The study demonstrates value of biomass monitoring by FTIR, importance of optimal solvent to co-solvent ratio, as well as careful selection and implementation of internal standards for gas chromatography. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Nearly a fourth of all enzymatic activities is attributable to oxidoreductases, and the redox reactions supported by this vast catalytic repertoire sustain cellular metabolism. In many biological processes, reduction depends on hydride transfer from either reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or its phosphorylated derivative (NADPH). Despite longstanding efforts to regenerate NADPH by various methods and harness it to support chemoenzymatic synthesis strategies, the lack of product purity has been a major deterrent. Here, we demonstrate that a nanostructured heterolayer Ni–Cu2O–Cu cathode formed by a photoelectrochemical process has unexpected efficiency in direct electrochemical regeneration of NADPH from NADP+. Remarkably, two-thirds of NADP+ was converted to NADPH with no measurable production of the inactive (NADP)2 dimer and at the lowest reported overpotential [− 0.75 V versus Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) reference]. Sputtering of nickel on the copper-oxide electrode nucleated an unexpected surface morphology that was critical for high product selectivity. Our results should motivate design of integrated electrolyzer platforms that deploy this heterogeneous catalyst for direct electrochemical regeneration of NADH/NADPH, which is central to design of next-generation biofuel fermentation strategies, biological solar converters, energy-storage devices, and artificial photosynthesis. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Fast Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) has emerged as a versatile means of converting wet biomass into bio-crude oil. This study was aimed to explore a fast hydrothermal co-liquefaction (co-HTL) platform to valorize corn stover and cow manure by evaluating several reaction parameters (i.e., residence time, reaction temperature, and feedstocks mass ratio). The highest yield (over 24 wt%) of bio-crude oil was achieved under the moderate condition (400 °C, 16 min, and the mass ratio of 1:1). The Higher heating value (HHV) of bio-crude oil was around 34 MJ/kg. Up to 43% of selectivity toward phenols in bio-crude oil was gained from fast co-HTL maintained for 30 min. The properties of hydrochar were comprehensively characterized by CHNS elemental analysis, SEM, EDX, and FTIR. The highest HHV of hydrochar was 27.31 MJ/kg, suggesting the high potential as a solid fuel. CO2 as the dominant gaseous fraction were identified and quantified by GC. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The synchronized transformation of molasses, sugarcane juice, glucose, fructose, and sucrose into water insoluble platform chemicals, has stand up as a resourceful exercise to eradicate the expensive separation steps. On the other hand, the existing processes involve both acid-catalyzed and hydrogenation processes. We report herein, new green approaches for sequential conversion of sugarcane biorefinery products into biofuels using metal free carboxyl acid functionalized ionic liquid entangled porphyrin (CAFILP) photo-catalyst. Both levulinic acid (LA) and hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) are water soluble and difficult to separate from the reaction mixture. Remarkably, the reaction of mixture containing LA and HMF easily converted to ethyl levulinate that considerably increases the yield of levulinate by affording another transformation technique excluding the hydrogenation step. The photo-catalytic activity of CAFILP affords ethyl levulinate (94%) and HMF (70%) yield that matches the acidic strength articulated by the Hammett acidity function. Photo-catalyst CAFILP exhibited intense absorptions in the visible regions with low band gap (1.49 eV) for visible light absorption is a key step of photocatalytic performance to convert sugarcane bio-refinery products into biofuels. The yield of HMF/LA was the highest from molasses, comprising more fructose that facilitates faster conversion compare to other biomass sources. Other products of sugarcane bio-refinery like sugarcane juice, sucrose, glucose, and fructose also have potential to add value in the bioenergy chain, affording HMF as the main product using optimized reaction conditions in presence of CAFILP photo-catalyst. The reusability of photocatalyst (up to 5 runs) was confirmed by easy filtration with good photo-catalytic activity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A barium-modified zeolite (Ba-ZEL) catalyst was developed via co-precipitation technique followed by thermal treatment (calcination) at different temperatures (600, 700 and 800 °C). The thermal stability, elemental composition, surface functional groups, crystallographic structure, textural characteristics, basic strength and surface morphology of the Ba-ZEL catalyst were determined using TGA/DTA, EDX, FTIR, XRD, BET, CO2-TPD and SEM techniques, respectively. The biodiesel production process conditions, such as catalyst loading, alcohol to oil ratio, temperature and time, were optimized using a central composite design approach. The Ba-ZEL composite calcined at 700 °C was selected as a representative catalyst due to its high activity for the waste frying oil (WFO) conversion, resulting in a maximum biodiesel yield of 93.17 ± 0.02% under optimum conditions (3.0 wt% catalyst loading, 12:1 methanol to WFO ratio, 65.38 °C reaction temperature and 2 h reaction time). The produced biodiesel, which was characterized by the FTIR and GC-FID analyses, contained sufficient ester groups and was in accordance with the specifications of EN 14214. Additionally, its physicochemical properties met ASTM D6751 specifications. Moreover, the Ba-ZEL700 catalyst was reused for five cycles upon regeneration using n-hexane washing followed by reactivation at 110 °C for 12 h. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Transportation is a crucial aspect of global development and the utilization of fossil fuels in most combustions systems seems inevitable. This class of fuel has led greatly to worldwide environmental pollution with its attendant effects on human health and climate changes. Biofuels from biomass are sustainable and viable alternatives that can eliminate the problems associated with petroleum fuels and are most compatible with the existing combustion systems. Biodiesel will further ensure positive energy equilibrium through the conservation of natural resources to improve economic stability, environmental safety and a balanced ecosystem. Most previous works make use of edible oils, which can lead to food security and price challenges. With the abundance of non-edible oil sources unexploited, the choice of this study is directed towards producing biodiesel from a non-edible seed with little or no information on its combustion properties. This study extracted Sandbox (Hura crepitans) oil chemically using analytical n-hexane as solvent and subsequently produced biodiesel from the oil via one step-transesterification. The biodiesel was characterized according to global standards for biodiesel (ASTM D6751 and EN 14214) and blended with petrodiesel to give five fuel samples (D100, B10, B20, B30 and B100). These fuels were combusted in a compression ignition (CI) engine test bed to determine its performance and emission characteristics. The results showed that the Sandbox seed produced oil with a good oil yield of 47.77% and the biodiesel produced had a yield of 86.49%, which satisfies the recommended global standards. B10 exhibited the best and highest BTE after D100 at all the torque levels (4 Nm, 6 Nm and 7 Nm) as well as the least and the most desirable emission of CO2 when compared with all the other fuels. The utilization of Sandbox biodiesel in combustion ignition engine was found to be a viable option at enhancing biofuel utilization and reduction of pollutant emissions from the present combustion of fossil fuels. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Beet pulp is an extremely very wet organic waste derived from sugar production. It can be utilized for energy purposes, e.g. biogas production or as very valuable fodder for animals, mainly horses. The high moisture content (80%) in beet pulp makes it an adequate feedstock for the hydrothermal carbonization process. Therefore, this study is focussed on the hydrothermal carbonization of beet pulp. The following parameters were studied: temperatures of 180, 200, and 220 °C through 1, 2, 3, and 4 h of residence time. The optimal conditions of the process were determined (220 °C and 1 h), based on the physical and chemical properties of solid product hydrochar. The ultimate and proximate analyses, high heating value, energy and mass yields, and energy densification ratio were investigated. The obtained hydrochars were of a coal-like solid biofuel, with high heating values much higher than raw feedstock (c.a. 150% higher). The combustion performance and kinetics of hydrochar based on TGA were determined, indicating better combustion. Moreover, the fibre analysis of hydrochar, supported by infrared spectra and scanning microscope analysis confirmed the changes in its structure. Concluding, organic waste, beet pulp, is of great potential as an energy source using the hydrothermal pretreatment process. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Sludge palm oil is a by-product produced as a result of oil loss into waste streams during the palm oil milling process. It is non-edible, inexpensive and abundantly available, thus making it an attractive feedstock for biodiesel production. However, it contains high contents of water and free fatty acids, rendering the conventional alkali-catalyzed process unsuitable. Therefore, this research aimed to improve the production of biodiesel from sludge palm oil using a low-cost liquid lipase (Eversa® Transform 2.0) produced from a genetically modified Aspergillus oryzae. The activity of the liquid lipase was determined to be 9600 IU mL−1. We performed the reaction using low-input process conditions with only 0.2 wt% enzyme concentration and 5:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio at a low operating temperature of 45 °C. Under an optimum stirring speed of 750 rpm, a crude biodiesel with a high ester content of approximately 94 wt% could be produced. Additionally, the crude glycerol produced has a higher purity compared to that produced via a chemical-catalyzed process. Overall, an economical and sustainable enzymatic process for the conversion of sludge palm oil into high quality biodiesel and glycerol has been demonstrated in this study. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The development of efficient processes for the upgrading of low value bio-derived liquid intermediates to high added value products in biorefineries is critical for the establishment of a robust and competitive bio-based economy. We show in this paper that low quality surrogate heavy naphtha, representative of biofuels from thermochemical biomass conversion processes, can be efficiently converted to high quality fuel and chemicals (olefins) via hydroisomerization and catalytic cracking, respectively. Hydroisomerization over a low loading 0.1 wt% Pt/ZSM-5 catalyst leads to the conversion of normal paraffins to C5-C8 isoparaffins with limited cracking, and produces a fuel with higher octane and lower cetane number, suitable for use in future powertrains such as HCCI engines. Catalytic cracking of the naphtha on a commercial ZSM-5 based FCC catalyst results in the production of a significant amount of olefins at 600 °C, primarily propylene followed by ethylene, n-butene, pentene and i-butene. Both processes are validated on pilot scale. Some differences observed between bench and pilot scale results are due to scalability phenomena and different reaction conditions. Still, excellent agreement with regards to the composition of the products at similar conversion level exists, demonstrating the scalability and applicability of these upgrading processes in thermochemical biorefineries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biorefining of second-generation feedstock gains more attention to improve the living standards and promote circular bioeconomy. The biorefinery concept made an effort to make the environmentally sustainable and economical products. Lignocellulosic biomass is widely available and extensively tested feedstock to produce biofuels, bioenergy and different value- products. By the integration of process to fractionate the lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose can add more values in the process chain that required integration and optimized technologies followed by life cycle analysis and economic assessment. The life cycle and economic analysis together assess the impacts on environment, economic and all the impacts which are involved indirectly throughout the product stages from cradle to grave. The improvement and integration of the current biorefinery process recommends the newer and sustainable bio-economy and will replace the fossil fuels with the renewable reserve. In techno-economic perspective, the optimization of integrated technologies for the production of biofuels and other bioproducts have still to be optimized for efficient production. The proper adoption of pretreatment methods increases the economic value in biorefinery process. The main aim of this review is to summarize the three key research areas that required more attentions, they are; (a) valorization of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose into value added products, (b) integrated biorefinery approach and process optimization; and (c) circular bioeconomy and its future perspective. This review concludes that the lignocellulosic integrated biorefinery approach is feasible to support the circular bioeconomy, through which number of value products could be derived. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is a promising technology for carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration to produce biofuel; however, its practical application is still a challenging due to lower biofuel production rates. This limitation can be alleviated by regulating the interfacial properties of biocathode. The present study investigates the feasibility of novel conducting polymer-based redox mediator modified electrodes to enhance the production of value-added chemicals. The redox mediators investigated in the study are neutral red (NR) and methyl viologen (MV), while polyaniline (PANI) was chosen as supporting conducting polymer. The electrochemical properties of MV-PANI and NR-PANI electrodes were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results displayed an increase in biofuel production rates for modified electrodes with MV-PANI and NR-PANI electrodes showing respectively 1.3- and 1.1-times higher production of acetate respectively, as compared to plain Toray carbon paper electrodes. Furthermore, the coulombic efficiencies of acetic acid followed the trend: MV-PANI (74.15 ± 5%) &gt; NR-PANI (64.20 ± 5%) &gt; TCP (52.40 ± 5%). The improved performance of modified electrodes compared to plain carbon paper electrode could be attributed to increased extracellular electron transfer, reduced internal resistance of the system and enriched biofilm formation on the modified cathode. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cardoon is low-input biomass which can be efficiently exploited in the modern biorefinery for multi-purpose uses. In this work, cardoon lignocellulosic stalks underwent to acid-catalyzed steam explosion. A design of experiments approach was employed to assess the effect of the process variables (acid concentration, temperature and reaction time) on xylan recovery after direct hydrolysis and cellulose digestibility in the enzymatic hydrolysis step. According to the statistical model generated, the optimal conditions to maximize overall monosaccharides yield were 166 °C, 1.45% (w/w) and 10 min. A monosaccharides production and inhibitors formation of 36.76 g/100 g raw material (close to 70% of the maximal theoretical yield) and 1.80 g/100 g raw material, respectively, were achieved. The scale-up of the hydrolysis step showed superior performance of the washed solid fraction than to the whole slurry, resulting in cellulose conversion to glucose by 76% vs 58%. By employing the life cycle assessment approach, it was possible to determine the environmental impact in terms of the global warming potential (3.18 kgCO2eq/kg of fermentable carbohydrates) and cumulative energy demand (43.34 MJ/kg of fermentable carbohydrates). The low-inhibitor and high-sugar hydrolysate can be fermented to biochemicals and biofuels without any detoxification process. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Presently more energy is sourced from the natural gas grid than the electricity grid in the EU and the US. Furthermore hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy-duty transport are not readily served by electricity. Decarbonised energy systems will require renewable fuels (such as biomethane) to reduce the reliance on fossil-based diesel and natural gas. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a technology which with other bio-based technologies can effect improved energy conversion and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across sectors beyond energy. Here, an AD-centred cascading circular system with carbon capture and utilisation was proposed by incorporating power to gas (P2G), microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), and digestate valorisation for biochar production. The system as modelled converted CO2 to biomethane and digestate to biochar for CO2 sequestration. This was exemplified through cattle slurry with an annual production of 3.03 billion tons in three studied regions (the EU, China and the US), which was shown to produce a maximum of 2.29 EJ (equivalent to 1.64% of natural gas demand in 2018) of total energy in the form of advanced biofuels (biomethane, bio-oil and syngas) via the AD-MEC system, which was preferable to a conventional AD or an AD-P2G system. The treatment of cattle slurry with AD-MEC led to a combined 397.4 MtCO2e of GHG emission savings in the three regions. This could contribute to avoiding 2.0% of GHG emissions (total 20.1 GtCO2e) in the three regions. The sustainability of such a system was shown to be dependent on access to low-carbon and low-cost electricity systems. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Waste-to-energy is a promising approach to tackle the energy shortage and reduce the environmental pollution. The present study aimed to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of microwave vacuum co-pyrolysis of seaweeds and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Although the three studied seaweeds namely; Ulva intestinalis, Sargassum polycystum, and Hypnea valentiae showed similar thermal weight loss profile, U. intestinalis showed the highest biomass and bio-oil yields which resulted in superior bio-oil areal productivity of 30.1 g m−2. Therefore, it was selected for co-pyrolysis with LDPE at different blend ratios. Compared to individual pyrolysis of U. intestinalis, the increase inLDPE ratio enhanced the crude bio-oil production with simultaneous reduction in bio-char yield. The experimental bio-oil yields from co-pyrolysis showed higher values than the corresponding theoretical values, confirming a synergistic effect between the two feedstocks. The bio-oil produced from co-pyrolysis at 75% LDPE blend ratio showed better characteristics compared to the individual pyrolysis. Van Krevelen plot suggested that LDPE produces hydrogen radicals during co-pyrolysis reactions, which increased the H/C ratio and reduced the O/C ratio. GC/MS analysis confirmed that the increase in LDPE stimulates hydrocarbons proportion up to 51.2% at 75% blend ratio with significant reduction in N-containing compounds, carboxylic acids, furans, aldehydes/ketones, saccharides, and phenols. The economic feasibility analysis at a feedstock feeding rate of 11.4 ton h−1 using Aspen Plus showed estimated net profit of 23.17 million US$ for a 20-years life time plant. The present study provides a potential approach for sustainable energy recovery from waste plastic/seaweeds blend using microwave vacuum co-pyrolysis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Activated carbons have recently emerged as renewable and efficient catalysts in converting low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into valuable chemical and fuels, while the effects of various structure characters and operating conditions on the catalytic reactions of LDPE have not been well interpreted. Here, the renewable Chestnut shell is used to produce catalyst (CNSACC), then applied in catalytic pyrolysis process for the first time to conclude fatidic perception in the optimal process in improving jet fuel range aromatics and H2-enriched fuel gas. Activating reagent concentration and carbonization temperature play critical roles in the specific surface area and acidity, having optima conditions in obtaining target chemicals due to unique inherent structure of parent CNS. The catalytic temperature and catalyst loading also give rise to different catalytic performance. The results showed that the main compositions of attained bio-oil are belonged to jet fuel range hydrocarbons (up to 100%). The optimal selectivity of aromatics (95.88%) with a high content of H2 (65.37 vol%) could be achieved at a H3PO4/CNS ratio of 0.8, carbonization temperature of 850 °C, catalytic temperature of 550 °C and CNSACC/LDPE ratio of 1.0. This may provide fresh insight into fabricating catalyst from biomass, and give suggestions to upgradation of pyrolysis products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, significant attention has been dedicated to converting biomass carbohydrates into alkyl levulinates (biofuel additives) in alcoholic media, in search of various cheap and active solid catalysts through relatively easy pathways and from non-dangerous precursors. The synthesis of methyl levulinate (ML) using a new Brønsted/Lewis acid sites catalyst was investigated, emphasizing the influence of three parameters (catalyst loading, the molar concentration of fructose in methanol, and reaction temperature) on the process. The synthetized catalyst, SO42−/TiO2–La2O3 coating Fe3O4, was characterized by different techniques (FT-IR, XRD, TGA, TEM-EDX, ICP-OES). The design of the ML synthesis experiment was carried out using the Box-Behnken technique, while the response surface methodology was applied to obtain the optimized process conditions. A mathematical model of the catalytic synthesis was built, based upon first principles, and the experimental time variation of the reaction mixture concentrations was used to find, through regression, the values of the constants of a newly proposed kinetic model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To decrease the cost of biodiesel production, undeveloped nonedible Semen Abutili seed oil (SASO) was first used as a feedstock to prepare biodiesel. Some low-cost liquid lipases were screened and used as green catalysts for biodiesel production via the ethanolysis of SASO. The effect of reaction factors on ethanolysis was optimized by the response surface methodology (RSM). The results demonstrated that SASO was a promising alternative feedstock, and Eversa® Transform 2.0 showed the best performance for biodiesel production from low-quality SASO feedstock (high FFA and phospholipid contents). In addition, Eversa® Transform 2.0 can be reused 3 times without significant loss. The influence of reaction factors on biodiesel yield decreased in the order of reaction temperature &gt; lipase load &gt; reaction time. The maximum biodiesel yield was 94.2 ± 1.3 % under the optimal conditions (lipase load 6%, water content 20 %, 7:1 (mol/mol) ethanol to SASO, 11 h, 37 °C). The kinetic parameters (Vmax and K'm) of the transesterification of SASO were 4.16 × 10−2mol/(L∙min) and 5.27 × 10-1 mol/L, respectively. The Arrhenius equation and activation energy, Ea, of Eversa® Transform 2.0-catalyzed transesterification of SASO were lnV0 = 4.8252–2382.3/T and 19.80 kJ/mol, respectively. The biodiesel produced from SASO was accordance with the ASTM D6751 standard, except for the oxidation stability. Thus, SASO, an undeveloped nonedible low-quality vegetable oil, can be used as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production, and the low-cost liquid lipase Eversa® Transform 2.0 can be used for biodiesel production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The automotive industry is directly affected by the shortage of fossil fuels and the excessive pollution resulting from crude oil-based fuels has many adverse effects on the environment. The search for a greener and sustainable source of materials and fuels to power automobiles has ultimately led to the usage of biomass and biobased sources as the main precursor due to its graft availability and renewability. Biobased fuels developed have been shown to easily blend in with the existing automobile engines and to provide sustainable performance. Similarly, the usage of various biobased polymers, plastics, and composite materials as the structural materials for the construction of automobiles instead of crude oil sources have shown to be invaluable. The powering of automobiles with electricity is the future of the transportation industry to address the greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil fuels. Hence, biobased lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors have started to enter the mid-sized automotive industry. However, extensive commercialization of biobased products application in the automotive sector is underdeveloped. Hence it is customary to assess the various drawbacks of using biobased materials and identify the correct pathway for new research and development in this field. Therefore, this review covers various applications of biobased products in the automotive industries and mentions the active researches going on in this field to replace petroleum and crude oil-based sources with biobased sources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The activity of Mo2C-based catalyst on vegetable oil conversion into biofuel could be greatedly promoted by tuning the carbon content, while its modification mechanism on the surface properties remained elusive. Herein, the exposed active sites, the particle size and Lewis acid amount of Ni-Mo2C/MCM-41 catalysts were regulated by varying CH4 content in carbonization gas. The activity of Ni-Mo2C/MCM-41 catalysts in jatropha oil (JO) conversion showed a volcano-like trend over the catalysts with increasing CH4 content from 15% to 50% in the preparation process. The one prepared by 25% CH4 content (Ni-Mo2C(25)/MCM-41) exhibited the outstanding catalytic performance with 83.9 wt% biofuel yield and 95.2% C15–C18 selectivity. Such a variation of activity was ascribed to the most exposed active sites, the smallest particle size, and the lowest Lewis acid amount from Ni0 on the Ni-Mo2C(25)/MCM-41 catalyst surface. Moreover, the Ni-Mo2C(25)/MCM-41 catalyst could also effectively catalyze the conversion of crude waste cooking oil (WCO) into green diesel. This study offers an effective strategy to improve catalytic performance of molybdenum carbide catalyst on vegetable oil conversion. © 2021 Science Press

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) have been proposed as a reliable power source for implantable biomedical devices because of their sustainability and biocompatibility. However, the limited reactant concentration in vivo and concerns about bioelectrode fouling and leaking have largely restricted the methods of assembling EBFCs and resulted in unsatisfactory performance. In this study, we design a novel enzymatic slurry bioanode wrapped by a dialysis membrane in which enzymes, electron mediators and nanomaterials are dispersed instead of immobilized on an electrode. Notably, a novel two-dimensional metal carbide nanomaterial, Ti3C2 MXene, is adopted for the first time in EBFCs as a large surface area and highly conductive nanosheet. Using the MXene-based slurry bioanode, a maximum power density of about 320 μW cm−2 and a maximum current density of 2.1 mA cm−2 are generated under flow conditions with phosphate buffer solution containing 5 mM glucose at 25 °C. In addition, a long-term continuous discharge for about 20 days is achieved with a 5 μA discharge current. This prototype is promising for the implantation and longtime operation of EBFCs in vivo. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Liquid fossil fuels (1) enable transportation and (2) provide energy for mobile work platforms and (3) supply dispatchable energy to highly variable demand (seasonal heating and peak electricity). We describe a system to replace liquid fossil fuels with drop-in biofuels including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Because growing biomass removes carbon dioxide from the air, there is no net addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from burning biofuels. In addition, with proper management, biofuel systems can sequester large quantities of carbon as soil organic matter, improving soil fertility and providing other environmental services. In the United States liquid biofuels can potentially replace all liquid fossil fuels. The required system has two key features. First, the heat and hydrogen for conversion of biomass into high-quality liquid fuels is provided by external low-carbon energy sources–nuclear energy or fossil fuels with carbon capture and sequestration. Using external energy inputs can almost double the energy content of the liquid fuel per unit of biomass feedstock by fully converting the carbon in biomass into a hydrocarbon fuel. Second, competing effectively with fossil fuels requires very large biorefineries—the equivalent of a 250,000 barrel per day oil refinery. This requires commercializing methods for converting local biomass into high-density storable feedstocks that can be economically shipped to large-scale biorefineries. © 2021

AB  - The present study investigates the suitability of preheated Vateria indica methyl ester (VIME) as an alternative fuel for a diesel engine. VIME is a renewable, non-toxic and sustainable alternative biodiesel obtained from Dhupa fat by transesterification. This study aims to evaluate the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of four different blends such as B0 (0% VIME and 100% mineral diesel), B30, B50 and B100 at elevated fuel inlet temperatures ranging from 35 °C to 95 °C. The tests are carried out in a single cylinder diesel engine at optimum loading condition and fixed speed. Results are obtained in terms of brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate and exhaust emissions (CO, HC, NOX, CO2 and soot). It is observed that the preheating of blends decreases the viscosity which enhances fuel spray characteristics, leading to higher engine performance, lower CO and HC emissions with a slight increase in NOX and CO2 emissions. BTE and peak in-cylinder pressure for B100 at 95 °C and 75% load are increased by 7.44%, 2.97% respectively compared to unheated B100 biodiesel. BSFC, CO, HC emissions at 75% load for B100 at 95 °C are reduced by 26.73%, 28.08%, 42.7% respectively compared to unheated B100. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The esterification of levulinic acid under acidic conditions to produce levulinate esters is of current significant interest due to the potential of these compounds as fuels and fuel additives. While a number of bespoke heterogeneous catalysts have been reported to be effective for this transformation, the use of widely available commercial catalysts has generally proved to be ineffective, with only low conversions to ester products being achieved. Herein, we report a novel strategy for the efficient synthesis of levulinate esters from levulinic acid in the presence of trialkyl orthoformates or dialkyl acetals and ketals catalyzed by commercial catalysts, such as ZSM-5 and Amberlyst-15. These reactions proceed under mild conditions and in short reaction times to selectively produce high yields of levulinate esters. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the advent of global industrialisation and adaptation of smart life there is rise in anthropogenic pollution especially in water. Remediation of the pollutants (such as metals, and dyes) present in industrial effluents is possible via microbes and algae present in the environment. Microbes are used in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) for remediation of various organic and inorganic pollutants. However, for industrial scale application coupling the MFCs with photocatalytic and photoelectric fuel cell has a potential in improving the output of power. It can also be used for remediation of pollutants more expeditiously, conserving fossil fuels, cleaning environment, hence making the coupled hybrid fuel cell to run economically. Furthermore, such MFC inbuilt with algae in living or powder form give additional value addition products like biofuel, polysaccharides, biopolymers, and polyhydroxy alkanoates etc. This review provides bird's eye view on the removal of environmental pollutants by different biological sources like bacteria and algae. The article is focussed on diatoms as potential algae since they are rich source of crude oil and high value added products in a hybrid photocatalytic MFC. It also covers bottle necks, challenges and future in this field of research. © 2021

AB  - In this work, hydrotreating Callophyllum inophyllum oil (CIO) was performed using hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) supported catalyst prepared from a massively produced waste, coconut lumber sawdust (Cocos nucifera L.), using only K2CO3 as activating agent for a green process. Coconut lumber sawdust was carbonized at 700 °C for 2 h to obtain coke as starting material. The produced coke was then activated at various furnace temperature and K2CO3/Coke weight ratio to generate six different types of HPC supports: HPC2-600, HPC2-700, HPC3-600, HPC3-700, HPC4-600, and HPC4-700. Iodine value has shown that HPC prepared at 700 °C h using K2CO3/Coke weight ratio of 3 (HPC3-700) exhibited the best adsorptive capacity, thus, depicting the most promising potential as a hydrotreating catalyst. In the hydrotreatment of CIO at 550 °C for 2 h using 1:300 (catalyst:feed) weight ratio, with a small addition of Ni to the pore (2.76 wt%), Ni/HPC3-700 catalyst, possessing 400.6 m2 g−1 BET surface area and 1.076 mmol g−1 acidity value, was able to produce a satisfying result by yielding over 74 wt% liquid product with 65 wt% hydrocarbon compounds. According to reusability study, although a gradual decrease of deoxygenation effectivity can be reflected through a declining hydrocarbon production, the level of liquid product generated by the catalyst remained consistent after its 3rd use in the hydrotreatment. The use of a low-cost high performing catalyst for hydrotreating a highly available non-edible oil in this study has offered a more sustainable and economical biofuel production with an environmental benefit. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The catalytic effect of mineral components (K, Ca, Mg and Na), after pre-treatment by water leaching and adding NaCl, was evaluated in fast pyrolysis with the biomass of four types of agricultural waste (olive pomace, nutshell, almond shell, and pistachio shell). Water leaching proved to be effective at reducing mineral content in the raw materials, especially in terms of removing K. As a consequence, there was lower decarboxylation activity during fast pyrolysis, and a lower yield of phenolic compounds was obtained. The effect of adding NaCl was evaluated by varying its ratio in the blend (1, 3 and 5 wt%) and it promoted cracking and dehydration reactions, favoring the formation of light molecular-weight compounds as carboxylic acids. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The non-covalent modification of carbon nanotube electrodes with pyrene derivatives is a versatile approach to enhance the electrical wiring of enzymes for biosensors and biofuel cells. We report here a comparative study of five pyrene derivatives adsorbed at multi-walled carbon nanotube electrodes to shed light on their ability to promote direct electron transfer with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for H2O2 reduction. In all cases, pyrene-modified electrodes enhanced catalytic reduction compared to the unmodified electrodes. The pyrene N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester derivative provided access to the highest catalytic current of 1.4 mA cm−2 at 6 mmol L−1 H2O2, high onset potential of 0.61 V vs. Ag/AgCl, insensitivity to parasitic H2O2 oxidation, and a large linear dynamic range that benefits from insensitivity to HRP “suicide inactivation” at 4–6 mmol L−1 H2O2. Pyrene-aliphatic carboxylic acid groups offer better sensor sensitivity and higher catalytic currents at ≤ 1 mmol L−1 H2O2 concentrations. The butyric acid and NHS ester derivatives gave high analytical sensitivities of 5.63 A M−1 cm−2 and 2.96 A M−1 cm−2, respectively, over a wide range (0.25–4 mmol−1) compared to existing carbon-based HRP biosensor electrodes. A bacterial nanocellulose pyrene-NHS HRP bioelectrode was subsequently elaborated via “one-pot” and “layer-by-layer” strategies. The optimised bioelectrode exhibited slightly weaker voltage output, further enhanced catalytic currents, and a major enhancement in 1-week stability with 67% activity remaining compared to 39% at the equivalent electrode without nanocellulose, thus offering excellent prospects for biosensing and biofuel cell applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There is a growing interest in making the overall aviation industry more environmentally-friendly by developing advanced biofuels. In this context, the main driver is establishing feedstocks with lower environmental loads and higher energy use efficiency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the energy requirement and environmental impacts of hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) production from pennycress. The system boundary included pennycress production, logistics, oil extraction and conversion to HRJ, wastewater treatment, and electricity and steam generation. Energy allocation method was used for the analysis. The functional unit was considered to be one GJ of HRJ, and the biorefinery size was considered to be 18.9 million l/yr (5 million gal/yr) HRJ. Energy use efficiency of pennycress-based HRJ production was estimated to be 3.9–5.5 (90% central range), which was higher than that of HRJ from other oilseeds, such as canola. Global warming potential of pennycress-based HRJ (35–49 kgCO2eq/GJ of HRJ (90% central range)) was also lower than those of HRJ from similar oilseeds and the commercial jet fuel baseline. Pennycress production was the main contributor to the total energy use and environmental impacts of HRJ production, mainly due to the use of nitrogen fertilizer for production, and fuel combustion for farm operations. Pennycress yield was identified as the most sensitive parameter affecting the energy use efficiency and environmental impacts of HRJ production. The outcomes of this study are useful for identifying the performance targets towards improving energy use efficiency and environmental performance of pennycress-based HRJ production at the commercial scale. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel genetic algorithm-based feature selection approach is incorporated and based on these features, four different ML methods were investigated. According to the findings, ML models could reliably predict bio-oil yield. The results showed that Random forest (RF) is preferred for bio-oil yield prediction (R2 ~ 0.98) and highly recommended when dealing with the complex correlation between variables and target. Multi-Linear regression model showed relatively poor generalization performance (R2 ~ 0.75). The partial dependence analysis was done for ML models to show the influence of each input variable on the target variable. Lastly, an easy-to-use software package was developed based on the RF model for the prediction of bio-oil yield. The current study offered new insights into the pyrolysis process of biomass and to improve bio-oil yield. It is an attempt to reduce the time-consuming and expensive experimental work for estimating the bio-oil yield of biomass during pyrolysis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae are a potential candidate for biofuels, but the high cost and low biomass yield hinder the scale-up application of microalgae. In this study, a novel walnut shell based self-permeating biofilm reactor (WSPBR) was proposed for cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) and Scenedesmus obliquus (S. obliquus). Major influencing factors such as walnut shell size, light intensity and CO2 concentration were studied in detail. The results showed that CO2 can enhance the storage of metabolic products in microalgal cells. Thermodynamics analysis indicated that C. vulgaris and S. obliquus were likely to adhere on the surface of walnut shells. S. obliquus and C. vulgaris biomass reached the maximum values of 97.43 and 70.49 g m−2, respectively, corresponding to the walnut shell size of 0.8–1.2 mm, light intensity of 150 μmol m−2 s−1 and CO2 concentration of 2%. The lipid contents of these microalgal cells were 34.32% and 28.94%, respectively. These results indicated that WSPBR was an efficient system for microalgae cultivation as feedstock for biofuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 2-Methylfuran (MF) is considered as a promising second-generation biofuel for spark ignition engines. MF has better anti-knock ability, and the lower heating value of MF is close to that of conventional fuels. The production methods of MF have been largely improved over the last decade. However, the studies of MF on direct injection spark ignition (DISI) engines are quite limited, and little is known about the effects of engine control parameters on MF combustion at typical DISI engine operating conditions. In the present work, the effects of engine control parameters including spark timing, air–fuel ratio, injection timing, and injection pressure on combustion and engine performances of MF were studied at typical medium load and high load conditions on a single-cylinder spray-guided DISI engine, compared to gasoline and ethanol. The results show that the achievable spark timing range considering combustion phasing and knock limit for MF is larger than that of gasoline especially at high load. MF has more robustness to lean burn than gasoline and ethanol. The combustion characteristics and heat release of MF have low sensibility to the variation of injection timings. To achieve the same engine load MF requires up to 25% longer injection durations than gasoline, however, increased injection pressure can mitigate the injection duration differences between MF and gasoline. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Different solid base catalysts such as CaO/CeO2, CaO/Al2O3, and CaO/ZrO2 were used for the depolymerization of alkali lignin. Various reaction parameters including reaction solvents (ethanol and methanol), time (30, 60, 90 and 120 min) and catalyst amounts have been screened at reaction temperature of 180 °C. Catalytic liquefaction produced higher bio-oil yield and maximum bio-oil yield (50.0 wt%) was obtained with ethanol and methanol solvent using different catalysts (CaO/ZrO2, and CaO/CeO2). Non-catalytic reaction and support catalysts produced lower bio-oil yield (42.0–46.0 wt%). The bio-oil was analyzed using GC-MS, 1H NMR, TOC, CHNS and FT-IR. It has been seen from the bio-oil analysis that vanillin was the main product with about 41.8–62.2 area%. This is due to solid base catalyst significantly enhancing the β-O-4 cleavage which increased the bio-oil yield as well as the selectivity of compound. The fundamental vibrations band at 2943 and 2978 cm−1 were observed for methoxy proton in catalytic bio-oil with higher intensity compared to the non-catalytic bio-oil. Maximum higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil was observed with CaO/CeO2catalyst with methanol solvent (27.6 MJ/kg). It is suggested that the energy of the bio-oil can be enhanced by CaO/CeO2 catalyst using methanol solvent for liquefaction reaction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Magnetic mesoporous solid acid catalysts, designed as Fe3O4@SBA-15@HPW and Fe3O4@SBA-15-NH2-HPW, were prepared for the production of biodiesel by the transesterification of palm oil with methanol. The magnetic mesoporous carrier was modified by two different methods: post-gifting method and impregnation method. The structure of the catalysts was characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR, VSM, Pyridine-FT-IR, N2 adsorption-desorption and TGA. The results indicated that they all had ordered mesoporous and excellent paramagnetic. Both Fe3O4@SBA-15@HPW and Fe3O4@SBA-15-NH2-HPW had high content of Brønsted acid sites due to the loading of 12-tungstophosphoric acid, which made the two catalysts very active. Particularly, Fe3O4@SBA-15-NH2-HPW was very efficient in the transesterification of palm oil with methanol and gave a more than 91% biodiesel yield when the reaction was carried out at 150 °C with a 4 wt% catalyst amount at 20:1 methanol/oil molar ratio for 5 h Fe3O4@SBA-15-NH2-HPW prepared by the grafting method exhibited higher reusability, and the yield of biodiesel was more than 80% after 6 times cycles, which made the catalyst have an excellent industrial application prospect. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Adopting the biorefinery approaches on the coupled process of phycoremediation and biofuel production using freshwater microalgae. A green microalga, Scenedesmus sp., cultivated in various concentrations of domestic wastewater (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100%v/v). Maximum biomass productivity was obtained 62 mg/L/day cultivated in 100%v/v wastewater. During the stationary phase, the biomass was harvested adopting the flocculation technique. Interestingly, Scenedesmus sp., preferentially utilized 71.2% nitrate, 89.6% phosphorus, 23.5% calcium, 2% magnesium, 97.7% sulphate, 30% ammonia, 10.9% chloride, and 15.2% alkalinity in the wastewater which contribute to the wastewater treatment. Lipid productivity was found to be 19 mg/L/day. The fatty acid profile of transesterified lipids was characterized by adopting FT-IR, GC–MS, and 1H NMR. The extracted biomass was utilized for the feedstock for bioethanol production. The amount of reducing sugar was found to be 11.2% (w/v). Acid hydrolyzed reducing sugars subjected to fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCIM3288. Bioethanol was found to be 10.4 g/L after distillation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, a flexible self-powered biosensor system integrated with the diaper was reported to detect the composition of urine. The system was powered by an enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC), which used the glucose in urine as fuel to generate electricity. The EBFC was assembled in a diaper and connected with a power management system (PMS) possessing a capacitor as an energy storage device to drive a light emitting diode (LED) flashing. The frequency of LED flicker was proportional to the charging speed of the capacitor, which was determined by the generated power of EBFC. Therefore, the flashing of LED enabled to indicate the glucose concentration in urine when someone was wearing the diaper with EBFC. The biosensor system composed of EBFC, PMS and LED, was a self-powered sensor system without external power and enabled to detect the glucose level in urine of diabetic patients. In the process of experiment, the power density of EBFC could be up to 220 μWcm−2 in 5 mM glucose solution. In the range of 1–5 mM, the flashing frequency of LED was proportional to the glucose concentration (r = 0.994). Uric acid and carbamide were added to the sensor as interferences, and the results showed that it had good anti-interference ability. Obviously, the self-powered biosensor hold the potential application to warn the urine glucose level of diabetic patients with urinary incontinence. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The hydrogenation of levulinate esters to γ-valerolactone (GVL) is an important step in the transformation of biomass into biofuels. It is attractive to develop new efficient systems for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of levulinate esters to value-added GVL. In this work, a series of MoS2-based supported catalysts were prepared via an impregnation method for the CTH of biomass-derived ethyl levulinate (EL) to GVL. By comprehensive characterization and catalytic measurements, we found that the CTH activity of EL to GVL is closely related to the MoS2 morphology and acid distribution on the support. Among the catalysts with different supports, the AC support with abundant Lewis acid sites and large surface area facilitated the high dispersion of low stacked MoS2 slabs, and the MoS2-acid synergistic catalysis contributed to the superior activity and selectivity. The conversion of EL and the selectivity of GVL reached 97.2% and 91.2% under optimized conditions over the MoS2/AC catalyst (230 °C, 1 MPa H2, 1.5 h), respectively. We also conducted reaction kinetic experiments to reveal the relationship between the active site of the MoS2/AC catalyst and its catalytic performance, and the plausible reaction pathway and mechanism over MoS2/AC was proposed. The catalytic performance gradually declined during recycling tests due to the oxidation of MoS2 and can be easily recovered by resulfuration. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass to specifically depolymerise lignin moieties without the loss of carbohydrates as well as to minimize the generation of harmful intermediates during the process is a major challenge in the biofuel production process. In the present study, a nanoparticle mediated pretreatment strategy was developed to specifically depolymerise lignin from corn cob biomass. The synthesized nanoparticles possessed unique enzyme mimicking characteristics that can be exploited for the deconstruction of lignin moieties. The maximum delignification was 44% using cerium doped iron oxide nanoparticles within 24 h of incubation time, at 25 °C and a high solid loading of 20% (w/v). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry study revealed the production of various lignin degraded compounds in pretreated liquids such as fatty acid methyl esters, which are the major components of fuel biodiesel. Aromatic alcohols and aldehydes were also observed during lignin degradation that has industrial importance. The remaining pretreated solid residues rich in carbohydrates can be further utilized in the generation of reducing sugars and in turn biofuels such as bioethanol, biobutanol, and biohydrogen. The value of the crystallinity index increased from 0.39 to 0.46 by delignification, indicating a total increase in biomass crystallinity. Moreover, the increase in biomass porosity indicates good biomass digestibility and in turn high reducing sugar yield. After enzymatic hydrolysis of 50 g L-1 pretreated biomass, 18.1 g L-1 of glucose and 9.12 g L-1 of xylose were released at 24 h, while the control (untreated biomass) showed a negligible amount of sugar release after hydrolysis. The recovery of nanoparticles after delignification was almost 50% of the initial concentration. The recovered catalyst was further recycled and reused, providing 37.1% delignification in the second run and 30.8% in the third run. Therefore, the obtained results in the current study substantiate the feasibility of the employed enzyme mimicking nanoparticles in the process of lignin degradation and fermentable sugar release in an eco-friendly manner. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Plant biomass-based biofuels have gradually substituted for conventional energy sources thanks to their obvious advantages, such as renewability, huge quantity, wide availability, economic feasibility, and sustainability. However, to make use of the large amount of carbon sources stored in the plant cell wall, robust cellulolytic microorganisms are highly demanded to efficiently disintegrate the recalcitrant intertwined cellulose fibers to release fermentable sugars for microbial conversion. The Gram-positive, thermophilic, cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum possesses a cellulolytic multienzyme complex termed the cellulosome, which has been widely considered to be nature’s finest cellulolytic machinery, fascinating scientists as an auspicious source of saccharolytic enzymes for biomass-based biofuel production. Owing to the supra-modular characteristics of the C. thermocellum cellulosome architecture, the cellulosomal components, including cohesin, dockerin, scaffoldin protein, and the plentiful cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes have been widely used for constructing artificial cellulosomes for basic studies and industrial applications. In addition, as the well-known microbial workhorses are naïve to biomass deconstruction, several research groups have sought to transform them from non-cellulolytic microbes into consolidated bioprocessing-enabling microbes. This review aims to update and discuss the current progress in these mentioned issues, point out their limitations, and suggest some future directions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - A horizontal drum kiln is a traditional method widely used in Southeast Asian countries for producing biochar. An understanding of temperature conditions in the kiln and its influence on biochar properties is crucial for identifying suitable biochar applications. In this study, four agricultural residues (corncob, coconut husk, coconut shell, and rice straw) were used for drum kiln biochar production. The agricultural residues were turned into biochar within 100–200 min, depending on their structures. The suitability of biochar for briquette fuels was analyzed using proximate, ultimate, and elemental analysis. The biochar’s physical and chemical properties were characterized via bulk density, iodine number, pHpzc, SEM, and FTIR measurements. All biochars had low O/C and H/C ratios and negative charge from both carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. Coconut husk and shell biochar had desirable properties such as high heating value and a high amount of surface functional groups which can interact with nutrients in soil. These biochars are thus suitable for use for a variety of purposes including as biofuels, adsorbents, and as soil amendments. © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Pyrolysis is a promising and attractive way to convert lignocellulosic biomass into low carbon-emission energy products. To effectively use biomass feedstock with size distribution to produce biofuels, a comprehensive kinetic model of the process, occurring at particle level, is important. In this study, the population balance model (PBM)-distributed activation energy model (DAEM) coupled model is first time developed to predict biomass pyrolysis. The Population balance model is used to present the variable size distribution of solid, decomposed from virgin biomass to porous char. Two different kinetic models are embedded into the conservation equations of mass and energy. They are compared to demonstrate the prediction performance of heating-up time during the pyrolysis process of biomass with a normal size distribution. It is found that non-isothermal kinetics without and with DEAM capture the intra-particle temperature distribution. There is a noticeable difference of heating-up time between single and distributed particle size. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze a heavy-duty tractor diesel engine operating on diesel-biodies-bioethanol blends using exergetic, economic, and environmental life cycle assessment analyses. Diesel was mixed with biodiesel and bioethanol with volumetric ratios of 5–15% and 2–6%, respectively. Nine diesel–biodiesel-bioethanol blends and one baseline fuel were tested at different PTO shaft speeds ranging from 800 to 1000 rpm under full load operating conditions. Various exergetic, economic, and environmental indicators were computed to facilitate decision-making on fuel composition and PTO shaft speed. In general, increasing biodiesel concentration in the fuel blend could improve the exergetic, economic, and environmental indicators of the system. However, there was no clear pattern of the effects of bioethanol on the investigated indicators. Interestingly, most of the prepared fuel blends were exergetically, economically, and environmentally superior to diesel. The lowest weighted environmental impact (52.1 mPts/GJ) and PTO shaft power generation cost (0.18 USD/kWh) were found for the fuel blend containing 10 vol% biodiesel and 4 vol% bioethanol at the PTO shaft speed of 1000 rpm. This fuel blend also showed the highest resource utilization efficiency (29.3%) and environmental sustainability (26.1%) at the PTO shaft speed of 1000 rpm. The weighted environmental impact and PTO shaft power generation cost of the selected fuel blend were 44.3% and 46.2% lower than those of diesel, respectively. The resource utilization efficiency and environmental sustainability of the selected fuel blend were 97.3% and 99.8% higher than those of diesel, respectively. Overall, substituting a portion of diesel with biodiesel and bioethanol was proved to be an attractive strategy from the exergetic, economic, and environmental perspectives. The results obtained can be valuable in practical applications to enhance the sustainability and viability of power production in agricultural activities. The applied exergetic, economic, and environmental methodologies appear to be reliable and comprehensive tools for assessing the whole-life sustainability and viability of mineral-biofuel blends. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: A non-enzymatic glucose biofuel cell (GBFCs) with high-power density and adequate open-circuit potential in physiological environment is based on the improved hydrogen template electrodeposition of the platinum-nickel (PtNi) nanoalloys (the third step adopted a potential-step electrochemical synthesis instead of the conventional method). The morphology tests demonstrate that the highly porous PtxNi1-x nanoalloys exhibit broader pore-size distribution and larger specific electrochemically active surface area than the Pt monometallic nanostructures. Combined with cyclic voltammograms, polarization parameters and cell tests, degradation behavior measurements prove that the nanoalloy products display the excellent long-term stability and high electrocatalytic activity. Controlling the preparation conditions of the highly porous PtxNi1-x nanoalloys could control the morphology and nanostructure of the as-synthesis nanoalloys in order to improve the catalytic performance of these nanoalloys, which grants it great potentialities for controllable synthesis of electrocatalysts in the application of GBFCs.

AB  - In the current study, a purified lipase from Enterobacter sp. MG10 has been immobilized in three approaches, including lipase nano-flower (LNF), LNF/graphene oxide (GLNF), and cross-linked GLNF (CGLNF). The encapsulation yield (EY) and activity recovery (AR) were obtained in the range of 40.5 % to 81.0 % and 71.5 % to 132.2 % for lipase MG10, respectively. The best activity recovery was found (132.2 % for 0.02 mg ml−1 enzyme) in the presence of 200 mM of Cu2+ for 72 h incubation at 4 °C. The CGLNF showed broader pH and temperature activities compared to free lipase. Moreover, the CGLNF displayed a 60 % improvement in lipase activity after 28 days of incubation, compared to free lipase. Remarkably, the Km value of CGLNF was 0.980 mM toward the p-NPP substrate, whereas the Km value of free lipase was 17.11 mM at the same condition. Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency of CGLNF was 430.45 S−1 mM−1, compared with 21.32 S−1 mM−1 for the free lipase. The CGLNF showed 93 % efficiency in converting prosopis stephanina oil to biodiesel, whereas it found 63 % for the free lipase. Overall, these results showed the high potential of CGLNF nanobiocatalyst in synthetic biotechnology, especially in biodiesel production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel, the most suitable diesel fuel alternative, is currently gaining popularity due to its advantages and potential environmental protection. Besides, one of the environmental sustainability approaches in biodiesel production process would be the reuse of biomass waste. In this regard, this work focuses on sustainability and environmental factor assessment of waste cooking oil biodiesel production and the application of artificial neural networks to predict the biodiesel yield and its engine characteristics. The artificial neural network model was developed to predict the biodiesel yield, engine performance, and emission characteristics. It was observed that biodiesel production with 1% (wt/wt) catalyst concentration, 9:1 methanol to waste cooking oil molar ratio, 60 min reaction time with 500 rpm mixing intensity generates lesser wastes, and the process exhibits positive environmental impacts. In the process of predicting the biodiesel yield, the overall regression coefficient was calculated as 0.98. Moreover, in case of biodiesel fueled engine characteristics, the overall regression coefficient was computed as 0.99. It is disclosed from the analysis that artificial neural networks are excellent tools to simulate and predict the biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil and its engine characteristics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To understand the catalytic upgrading of bio-oil over char-based catalyst, pyrolysis of pine sawdust with various char catalysts under different reaction temperatures was performed in a fixed-bed reactor, from which the liquid product was analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The main pyrolytic liquids were ketones and acids in the non-catalytic pyrolysis run, which were mainly derived from the pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose in biomass by ring opening and side chain cracking reactions, while the relative content of phenolic substances obtained from catalytic reaction at 400 °C over CO2-activated char increased from 33.79% to 78.12% with the increasing char activation time from 0.5 to 2.0 h, resulting from the formation of more multiple active sites (including surface active groups and the pore characteristics) on activated char. When the catalytic reaction temperature reached 600 °C, the quality of the bio-oil was further improved since the relative content of aromatic hydrocarbons increased from 7.30% to 21.04% at the expense of elimination of some oxygen-containing compounds (e.g., ketones, acids, aldehydes, etc). Furthermore, the content of phenol in phenolic compounds increased from 26–64% to 51–97%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, lime (calcium hydroxide) treatment (LT) was applied as an alkaline pretreatment subsequent to hydrothermal treatment (HT) in terms of fermentable sugar and bioethanol production from acacia wood. To maximize the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose, the condition of 200 °C for 10 min of HT was selected for subsequent lime treatment. The optimum conditions of LT were established to be a ratio of calcium hydroxide to hydrothermally treated acacia biomass of 12.2%, temperature of 70.9 °C, and reaction time of 23.5 h using a response surface methodology, and the maximum glucose yield by prediction and experiment were determined to be 74.4% and 73.5%, respectively. Further mechanical refining accelerated the access of the enzyme to glucan, resulting in an increase in glucose conversion (80.5%). Although the glucose yield by LT was 21.5% higher than that of HT, the ethanol yield was 33.5% lower due to the negative effect of residual calcium ions on yeast fermentation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of corn straw with different catalytic systems and temperatures were investigated in this study. Results showed dual catalytic system can effectively promote the degradation of corn straw at low temperature. With increase of temperature, aqueous phase increased and straw residue decreased for all catalytic systems. The heavy bio-oil yield increased with the increasing of temperature for single catalytic system, while the trend was opposite for dual catalytic system. In single catalytic system, ZnFe2O4 was more suitable for preparation of heavy bio-oil, and the maximum yield reached 34.02 wt% at 180 °C. The proportion of monophenyl compounds in heavy bio-oil for dual catalytic system reached the maximum of 84% at 220 °C with ZnFe2O4. At 180 °C, the contents of Benzofuran,2,3-dihydro and 2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol reached the maximum of 31.42% and 17.64% in CoFe2O4 catalyst system, and the maximum yield of Vanillin was 10.82% with ZnFe2O4. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tin zirconium oxide catalysts (Sn-based TMOs) were successfully prepared with three different methods, ultrasonic-assisted hydrothermal, sol-gel, and traditional precipitation method, and applied for biodiesel production. The physicochemical and the catalytic efficiency by the esterification of stearic acid of the as-synthesized catalysts were investigated by different techniques. The production of biodiesel (as methyl stearate) has emerged as a greener and renewable substitute for petro based diesel fuel. The optimization of the esterification conditions for maximum yield of biodiesel was performed by studying different factors as the catalyst preparation method, reaction time, molar ratio of alcohol to stearic acid, reaction temperature, and the catalyst concentration. The preferred catalyst (SnZrh) was optimized as the reaction temperature of 120 °C, 150 M ratio of methanol to stearic acid, 0.2 g catalyst amount and reaction time of 60 min. The SnZrh catalyst exhibited 74% yield of methyl stearate. Also, the kinetic and thermodynamic studies of stearic acid esterification reaction were inspected. The reusability of the optimized tin zirconium oxide catalyst for seventh runs was professionally studied. The computational chemistry study showed that the interaction mechanism between the optimized catalyst and stearic acid was preferable between SnO2 active sites and carbonic group of stearic acid. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of single-chamber MEC under applied voltages higher than that for water electrolysis. With different acetate concentrations (1.0–2.0 g/L), the MEC was tested under applied voltages from 0.8 to 2.2 V within 2600 h (54 cycles). Results showed that the MEC was stably operated for the first time within 20 cycles under 2.0 and 2.2 V, compared with the control MEC with significant water electrolysis. The maximum current density reached 27.8 ± 1.4 A/m2 under 2.0 V, which was about three times as that under 0.8 V. The anode potential in the MEC could be kept at 0.832 ± 0.110 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) under 2.2 V, thus without water electrolysis in the MEC. High applied voltage of 1.6 V combined with alkaline solution (pH = 11.2) could result in high hydrogen production and high current density. The maximum current density of MEC at 1.6 V and pH = 11.2 reached 42.0 ± 10.0 A/m2, which was 1.85 times as that at 1.6 V and pH = 7.0. The average hydrogen content reached 97.2% of the total biogas throughout all the cycles, indicating that the methanogenesis was successfully inhibited in the MEC at 1.6 V and pH = 11.2. With high hydrogen production rate and current density, the size and investment of MEC could be significantly reduced under high applied voltages. Our results should be useful for extending the range of applied voltages in the MEC. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study is dealt with the phenomenon of combustion for rice bran oil (RBO) methyl ester blends with diesel along with nanoparticles of magnelium. Nanoparticles composition of 25 ppm, 50 ppm, and 75 ppm are added to blends of B20, B40, and B60 in the study. A conversion rate of 89.64 ± 2.8% is observed during the transesterification reaction performed at 5 wt% of potassium hydroxide (KOH) catalyst, 10:1 alcohol to oil ratio (methanol), 75 °C reaction temperature, and 60 min reaction time. During the combustion study, few samples displayed the puffing characteristics, which are caused by popping of bubbles at lower pressure. The summary of the present study suggested that blend B20 with 25 ppm nanoparticles has the potential to be used as fuel and further proposed that the fuel will be more economical if the injection droplet diameter is 0.77 mm. Other blends like B20 with 75 ppm are also likely to be used as fuel due to its exhibition of lesser threat towards combustion. Bubble formation followed by micro-explosion is observed in B60 with 25 ppm blend. The present study hoped to enrich future researchers working in similar area for signifying the importance of understanding droplet combustion of biofuels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this research, a biorefinery plant is proposed to generate biofuel through fast pyrolysis and gasification. The proposed biorefinery comprises hydrotreating, hydrocracking, and steam reforming sections. The whole plant, each section, and each designed component are analyzed and evaluated based on an exergy-based approach, i.e., exergy, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental analyses. The exergy cost and exergoenvironmental impact of each section and each component are calculated and compared to monitor the economic effect and environmental impact and also to prioritize the section and the component which are not obtained as acceptable values in the analyses. It is revealed that the hydrocracking unit is the most efficient sector in comparison with others with the exergy efficiency of 89.75%. The exergoeconomic analysis illustrates that the used compressor in the hydrotreating unit and pumps in hydrocracking and steam reforming units have the most exergy cost in comparison with other components in the whole process. Similarly, exergoenvironmental assessment declares that employed reactors of the biorefinery plant have the most destructive effect on the environment. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Catalytic properties of the tungstated alumina (WA) supported catalysts with different nature and content of active metal (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Ni) were studied in the continuous flow hydrodeoxygenation of sorbitol at a temperature of 653 K, a pressure of 4.0 MPa, and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 1.0 h−1. The catalysts were characterized by N2 physical adsorption, H2-TPR, CO chemisorption, TEM, and NH3-TPD. It was found that all catalysts provide complete conversion of sorbitol with the formation of C5–C7 hydrocarbons as the main products which include n-alkanes, cycloalkanes, and isoalkanes. The yield of С5–С7 hydrocarbons after 1 h of the reaction increases from 42 to about 74 mol% in a series of catalysts: 5% Ni/WA &lt; 0.5% Ru/WA &lt; 0.5% Pd/WA &lt; 0.5% Rh/WA &lt; 0.5% Pt/WA. The calculated value of the research octane number (RON) for the С5–С7 mixture rises from ca. 62 to 80 in a series of catalysts: 0.5% Pt/WA &lt; 0.5% Pd/WA &lt; 0.5% Rh/WA &lt; 5% Ni/WA &lt; 0.5% Ru/WA. The stable yield and RON values (no less than 57 mol% and 70, respectively) of С5–С7 hydrocarbon mixture are achieved during hydrodeoxygenation over the 0.5% Pd/WA catalyst for 8 h. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The hydroxyl groups adjacent to the β-1,4 glycosidic linkages in cellulose offer a crystalline structure, which makes depolymerization a difficult task. In the present study, a green synthesized nanomaterial, functionalized few-layer graphene (FFG) possessing exclusive cellulase enzyme mimicking properties, was exploited for the depolymerization of corn cob (CC)-derived cellulose moieties. Here, we studied the combined effect of cellulase and a very low concentration of FFG (0.02 wt% of biomass) on CC-derived cellulose hydrolysis, demonstrating 38% increase in hydrolysis compared to the control (i.e.without FFG). Most importantly, hydrolysis experiments were performed under mild conditions,i.e.at 50 °C, generating fermentable sugars without the formation of any inhibitor compounds. Furthermore, hydrolyzed CC cellulose was employed for bioethanol fermentation bySaccharomyces cerevisiaewhich produced 1.53 times higher ethanol in the presence of FFG. The residual solid part was further utilized for the formation of cellulose based nano-composite films. Here, we tried to develop a zero waste process by utilizing each component which can be an attractive sustainable option. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the cellulase mimicking activity of FFG nanosheets and their application in the hydrolysis of CC cellulose for improved bioethanol production, which can negate the need for costly cellulase enzymes required for biomass hydrolysis. Hence, the FFG-associated biomass to bioethanol process may pave the way toward the development of green sustainable biofuel technology for its foremost use as transport fuel. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - The economy of biorefineries is influenced not only by biofuel production from carbohydrates but also by the production of valuable compounds from largely underutilized industrial residues. Currently, the demand for many chemicals that could be made in a biorefinery, such as succinic acid (SA), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), and lactic acid (LA), is fulfilled using petroleum, palm oil, or pure carbohydrates as raw materials, respectively. Thin stillage (TS), the residual liquid material following distillation of ethanol, is an underutilized coproduct from the starch biofuel industry. This carbon-rich material has the potential for chemical upgrading by microorganisms. Here, we explored the formation of different fermentation products by microbial communities grown on TS using different bioreactor conditions. At the baseline operational condition (6-day retention time, pH 5.5, 35°C), we observed a mixture of MCFAs as the principal fermentation products. Operation of a bioreactor with a 1-day retention time induced an increase in SA production, and a temperature increase to 55°C resulted in the accumulation of lactic and propionic acids. In addition, a reactor operated with a 1-day retention time at 55°C conditions resulted in LA accumulation as the main fermentation product. The prominent members of the microbial community in each reactor were assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Under all operating conditions, members of the Lactobacillaceae family within Firmicutes and the Acetobacteraceae family within Proteobacteria were ubiquitous. Members of the Prevotellaceae family within Bacteroidetes and Lachnospiraceae family within the Clostridiales order of Firmicutes were mostly abundant at 35°C and not abundant in the microbial communities of the TS reactors incubated at 55°C. The ability to adjust bioreactor operating conditions to select for microbial communities with different fermentation product profiles offers new strategies to explore and compare potentially valuable fermentation products from TS and allows industries the flexibility to adapt and switch chemical production based on market prices and demands. © Copyright © 2021 Fortney, Hanson, Rosa, Donohue and Noguera.

AB  - The surface hydrophilicity of a gas-diffusion-type biocathode, in which bilirubin oxidase was immobilized, was regulated by varying the polymer binder hygroscopicity and UV-ozone treatment time of carbon composite electrodes. The surface hydrophilicity was found to influence its oxygen reduction activity by affecting the penetration of the electrolyte and O2 gas into the electrode layer. The oxygen reduction activity was maximized at an intermediate surface hydrophilicity because of the trade-off between enzyme utilization and oxygen diffusion. A glucose/O2 biofuel cell was fabricated by combining the optimal biocathode with a suitable bioanode fabricated with carboxylic acid-functionalized carbon nanotubes. We demonstrated that the glucose/O2 gas-diffusion-type biofuel cell exhibited a maximum current density of 3.0 mA cm-2 and a maximum power density of 0.66 mW cm-2. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - In this work, the production of renewable hydrocarbons was explored by the means of waste cottonseed oil (WCSO) micropyrolysis at 500◦C. Catalytic upgrading of the pyrolysis vapors was studied using α-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3, Mo-Co/γ-Al2O3, and Mo-Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The oxygen removal efficiency was much lower in non-catalytic pyrolysis (18.0%), whilst γ-Al2O3 yielded a very high oxygen removal efficiency (91.8%), similar to that obtained with Mo-Co/γ-Al2O3 (92.8%) and higher than that attained with Mo-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (82.0%). Higher conversion yields into total renewable hydrocarbons were obtained with Mo-Co/γ-Al2O3 (61.9 wt.%) in comparison to Mo-Ni/γ-Al2O3 (46.6%). GC/MS analyses showed a relative chemical composition of 31.3, 86.4, and 92.6% of total renewable hydrocarbons and 58.7, 7.2, and 4.2% of oxygenated compounds for non-catalytic bio-oil (BOWCSO), BOMoNi and BOMoCo, respectively. The renewable hydrocarbons that were derived from BOMoNi and BOMoCo were mainly composed by olefins (35.3 and 33.4%), aromatics (31.4 and 28.9%), and paraffins (13.8 and 25.7%). The results revealed the catalysts’ effectiveness in FFA decarbonylation and decarboxylation, as evidenced by significant changes in the van Krevelen space, with the lowest O/C ratio values for BOMoCo and BOMoNi (O/C = 0–0.10) in relation to the BOWCSO (O/C = 0.10–0.20), and by a decrease in the presence of oxygenated compounds in the catalytic bio-oils. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This study was devoted to proposing an effective experimental method based on bio-oil composition inversion for understanding biomass pyrolysis vapor evolution in four-staged condensers. The effective length of each condenser was 200 mm. The evolution curves and heat maps of condensable vapors in the whole multi-staged condensing field were provided by Logistics model fitting. With changing condition from “365-345-325-305” to “345-325-305-285”, the condensing efficiency of the first condenser increased by 100% but that of the third condenser decreased by 80%. Under condition “365-345-325-305”, the largest recovery rate of water was observed at 400 mm away from multi-staged condensing field entrance while that of eugenol was observed at 50 mm away from the entrance, which explained that water was primarily recovered by the second and third condensers whereas eugenol was recovered by the first condenser, and verified the remarkable effect of fractional condensation on the separation of water and high-boiling phenols. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study presents predictive modelling with uncertainty analysis, optimization and techno-economic feasibility of Bio-catalyzed Biodiesel Production from Azidirica Indica Oil (BCBPAIO). Central Composite Design (CCD) predictive model and optimum conditions for BCBPAIO were developed in Design Expert software. The model uncertainty analysis was performed using Monte Carlo simulation. The BCBPAIO simulation and economic analysis were conducted in ASPEN Batch Process Developer V10. The correlation coefficient (R2) and adjusted R2 value of the CCD model were 0.9922 and 0.9780 respectively. CCD model certainty gave 73.51% with 100,000 trials; the oil transesterification optimum conditions gave 87.04% conversion with 3.62 wt% of catalysts; and methanol to oil molar ratio of 8:1 at 59 °C for 4 h. The annual production cost, total capital investment, payback time and internal rate of returns are $ 3537105, $ 5243784, 2.67 and 43% respectively. This study shows that the production is profitably feasible. © 2021

AB  - The objective of this study is the applications of hybrid magnetic nanocomposites as catalyst as well as an adsorbent. Four magnetic nanocomposites (graphene and chitosan based) were fabricated using single pot solvothermal carbonization co-precipitation (STCC) route by integrating biomass functionalized with iron oxide nanoparticles. All hybrid nanocomposites were characterized for their magnetic, thermal, chemical and structural properties. Adsorption isotherms and kinetics studies were performed for adsorption of multi-heavy metals including Cd, Ni, Cu and Cr. Finally, the hybrid magnetic carbon nanocomposites were tested as catalysts to produce bio-oil through catalytic liquefaction of rice husk in supercritical ethanol. It was found that the bio-oil yield and overall conversion was enhanced significantly from 29.5% and 48.11% without catalyst, to 36.8% and 60.81% respectively with the presence of magnetic carbon nanocomposites as catalyst. Furthermore, the bio-oil energy quality was enhanced in energy content from 21.72 to 23.21 MJ/kg with the presence of catalyst and H/C and O/C ratios were reduced. Finally, GCMS revealed that the bio-oil produced using catalysts showed higher mass fraction of esters, hydrocarbons and reduced acid groups as compared to bio-oil. This study provides insights to the understanding of the role of hybrid magnetic nanocomposites for its expansion for future applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Present study presents the results of methyl esters preparation from Jatropha-Algae oil using transesterification process. In this study, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and the response surface methodology (RSM) based Box–Behnken techniques were used for modelling and analysis of different parameters viz molar ratio, temperature, reaction time, and catalyst concentration in biodiesel production process. Significant regression model with R2value of 0.9867 was obtained under a molar ratio of 6–12, KOH of 0–2% w/w, time of 60–180 min and temperature of 35–55 °C using RSM. The ANFIS model was used to individually correlate the output variable (biodiesel yield) with four input variables with R2 value of 0.9998. Finally, a study investigating the performance and emissions of a diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel blends (B0, B5, B10 and B20 vol%) has been performed concluding significant reduction of emission. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the dominating meat supply industries, the poultry chicken sector, is facing waste management concerns worldwide. Due to high oil content containment, biofuel researchers emphasized poultry waste as abundant, cheap, and high-quality feedstock for biodiesel production. Therefore, in the current study, an experimental investigation of biodiesel production from wasted chicken skin through the transesterification process has been performed. The chicken skin used in this study for biodiesel production can be used as the potential waste source for biodiesel production worldwide. Techno-economic, environmental, and sustainability analyses were also performed. During the synthesis, the reaction was conducted with potassium hydroxide (KOH), and the process yielded 48% biodiesel. The cost of electricity for providing electricity is estimated at US$0.575 per kWh when an auto-sized generator has been fueled by biodiesel. The environmental and substantiality analysis found that biodiesel is more suitable than conventional diesel as an environmentally friendly and sustainable fuel. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising thermochemical technology for the treatment of hazardous wastes such as penicillin residue (PR). For the treatment of aqueous waste produced by PR in the HTL process, aqueous phase circulation is an attractive solution, both environmentally and economically. The present study shows that aqueous phase circulation can promote the transfer of organic matter from the aqueous phase to bio–oil. The content of organic acids and alcohols in the aqueous phase decreased significantly, and the bio–oil yield and energy recovery efficiency also increased. Under non–catalytic conditions, the bio–oil yield increased from 26.09 wt% to 33.72 wt%. The use of Na2CO3 as a catalyst further improved the bio–oil yield. After a single aqueous phase circulation, the bio–oil yield increased to 34.63 wt%, and the energy recovery efficiency increased to 66.94%. Under catalytic hydrothermal conditions, the content of organic acids in the bio–oil was reduced using aqueous phase circulations, which improved the quality of the bio–oil. At the same time, the Na2CO3 catalyst promoted the hydrolysis of PR to form small molecule organic matter, inhibited the formation of coke, and reduced the content of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in the solid residue. An increase of cycle times led to excessive accumulation of Na2CO3, which had a negative impact on the yield of bio–oil. Nitrogen–containing compounds in the bio–oil increased to a certain extent, which renders it necessary to consider denitrification treatments in the future. The work provides a useful reference for further research on the preparation of high quality bio–oil by PR hydrothermal liquefaction. © 2021

AB  - A novel approach for upgrading the pore volume of biochar at low temperatures using a green additive of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is developed in this study. The biochar was produced from spent coffee grounds (SCGs) torrefied at different temperatures (200–300 °C) with different residence times (30–60 min) and NaHCO3 concentrations (0–8.3 wt%). The results reveal that the total pore volume of biochar increases with rising temperature, residence time, or NaHCO3 aqueous solution concentration, whereas the bulk density has an opposite trend. The specific surface area and total pore volume of pore-forming SCG from 300 °C torrefaction for 60 min with an 8.3 wt% NaHCO3 solution (300-TP-SCG) are 42.050 m2 g−1 and 0.1389 cm3·g−1, accounting for the improvements of 141% and 76%, respectively, compared to the parent SCG. The contact angle (126°) and water activity (0.48 aw) of 300-TP-SCG reveal that it has long storage time. The CO2 uptake capacity of 300-TP-SCG is 0.32 mmol g−1, rendering a 39% improvement relative to 300-TSCG, namely, SCG torrefied at 300 °C for 60 min. 300-TP-SCG has higher HHV (28.31 MJ·kg−1) and lower ignition temperature (252 °C). Overall, it indicates 300-TP-SCG is a potential fuel substitute for coal. This study has successfully produced mesoporous biochar at low temperatures to fulfill “3E”, namely, energy (biofuel), environment (biowaste reuse solid waste), and circular economy (bioadsorbent). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The activity of mesoporous Al-MCM-41 for deoxygenation ofReutealis trispermaoil (RTO) was enhancedviamodification with NiO nanoparticles. Deoxygenation at atmospheric pressure and under H2free conditions required acid catalysts to ensure the removal of the oxygenated fragments in triglycerides to form liquid hydrocarbons. NiO at different weight loadings was impregnated onto Al-MCM-41 and the changes of Lewis/Brønsted acidity and mesoporosity of the catalysts were investigated. The activity of Al-MCM-41 was enhanced when impregnated with NiO due to the increase of Lewis acidity originating from NiO nanoparticles and the mesoporosity of Al-MCM-41. Increasing the NiO loading enhanced the Lewis acidity but not Brønsted acidity, leading to a higher conversion towards liquid hydrocarbon yield. Impregnation with 10% of NiO on Al-MCM-41 increased the conversion of RTO to hydrocarbonsviathe deoxygenation pathway and reduced the products from cracking reaction, consequently enhancing the green diesel (C11-C18) hydrocarbon products. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Chemoselective deoxygenation of carbonyls and alcohols using hydrogen by heterogeneous base-metal catalysts is crucial for the sustainable production of fine chemicals and biofuels. We report an aluminum metal-organic framework (DUT-5) node support cobalt(II) hydride, which is a highly chemoselective and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for deoxygenation of a range of aromatic and aliphatic ketones, aldehydes, and primary and secondary alcohols, including biomass-derived substrates under 1 bar H2. The single-site cobalt catalyst (DUT-5-CoH) was easily prepared by postsynthetic metalation of the secondary building units (SBUs) of DUT-5 with CoCl2 followed by the reaction of NaEt3BH. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) indicated the presence of CoII and AlIII centers in DUT-5-CoH and DUT-5-Co after catalysis. The coordination environment of the cobalt center of DUT-5-Co before and after catalysis was established by extended X-ray fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) and density functional theory. The kinetic and computational data suggest reversible carbonyl coordination to cobalt preceding the turnover-limiting step, which involves 1,2-insertion of the coordinated carbonyl into the cobalt-hydride bond. The unique coordination environment of the cobalt ion ligated by oxo-nodes within the porous framework and the rate independency on the pressure of H2 allow the deoxygenation reactions chemoselectively under ambient hydrogen pressure. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The promoting action of W in the Ni-Al2O3 co-precipitated catalysts with high nickel loading (31–46 wt% Ni) has been investigated in the selective deoxygenation of sunflower oil and waste cooking oil towards green diesel production. A WNi-Al2O3 catalyst containing 8 wt% W and 35 wt% Ni ([Formula presented] atomic ratio) proven the most efficient. The detailed characterization of the catalysts allowed an insight concerning the tungsten promoting action. It was attributed to the increase in the catalyst specific surface area and metallic nickel surface area, the acidity regulation, the decrease of the amount of catalytically inactive nickel aluminate formed and to the participation of W5+-oxo species via their defect oxygen sites in the selective deoxygenation network. The optimum reduction – activation temperature was found at 500 °C, where a good compromise between the increase of metallic Ni relative amount, the decrease of the specific surface area and the increase of Ni mean crystal size is achieved. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrothermal treatment (HT) is a promising method to convert sewage sludge to hydrochar biofuel. The heating value is directly correlated to the carbon content in hydrochar; however, the release of organic matter from sludge to hydrolysate and the transfer of the Maillard reaction products generated in the hydrolysate to the solid phase alter the carbon content in hydrochar. In this study, the relationship between hydrolysate and heating value of sludge-based hydrochar was presented, aiming to explain how the calorific value of hydrochar was affected by HT conditions. We adopted a direct combustion test to verify its clean combustion features. Hydrochar derived at 260 °C and residence time of 4 h (HC 260-4) exhibited the highest calorific value (HHVdaf = 26.23 MJ/kg) with an energy density of 1.43, and its fuel characteristics were similar to those of lignite. The increase in the HT temperature and residence time up to 260 °C and 4 h, respectively, was beneficial for enhancing HHVdaf. Conversely, further increase of the HT temperature to 300 °C and HT time to 6 h yielded a decrease in HHVdaf. Investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed that the protein and polysaccharide releasing from sludge to hydrolysate occurred the Maillard reaction (MR). The generated humic-like Maillard reaction product (MRP) was transferred to hydrochar, inducing an increase in the carbon content and calorific value and a decrease in the organic content of hydrolysate. As the carbohydrate content in the hydrolysate decreased, the MR was terminated, so no more MRP was transferred to hydrochar. At the same time, the protein was still continuously released at higher temperatures and longer residence times, yielding a decline in the HHVdaf. Moreover, clean energy utilization was verified from the reduced nitrogen content in hydrochar and lower CO and NOx emission of HC 260-4 in the combustion test. After the HT, increased hydrophobicity and a lower fraction of bound water improved the dewaterability, which is of great significance for applying hydrochar as biofuel. The findings of this study provided a new perspective to explain the heating value generation of hydrochar and more direct evidence to assess its clean combustion properties, with promising perspectives for practical applications. © 2021

AB  - Vegetation has successfully been used for phytoremediation of heavy metal(loid) contaminated soils. Previous works found that the metal(loid)-enriched biomass can be converted into biofuels through pyrolysis. However, the potential emission of metal(loid)s at higher pyrolysis temperatures, the leaching potential of minerals in chars, and the quality of the products needs further consideration. In this work, the metal(loid)-enriched biomass was engineered by pre-mixing with magnesium carbonate to study the effect on pyrolytic product properties and metal(loid) deportment. Heavy metal contaminated mangrove grown in a land contaminated with a lead–zinc smelter slags was used as the biomass. The biomass and magnesium carbonate mixture as the feedstock was subjected to pyrolysis at temperatures from 300 to 900 °C under the heating rate of 10 °C/min. Results showed that the feedstock mainly decomposed at temperatures between 176 and 575 °C. Amongst the 10 studied metal(loid)s in this work, most elements exhibited more than 70% of elemental recovery in chars at pyrolysis temperatures up to 700 °C. Pyrolysis also enhanced heavy metal stability in chars produced at temperatures above 300 °C. This study indicated that co-pyrolysis of heavy metal contaminated biomass with magnesium carbonate enabled the pyrolysis temperature up to 700 °C with minimal environmental risks, providing a safe and value-added way of phytoremediation residual management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are well-known artificial enzymes with peroxidase (PO)-like activity. PBAs have a high potential for applications in scientific investigations, industry, ecology and medicine. Being stable and both catalytically and electrochemically active, PBAs are promising in the construction of biosensors and biofuel cells. The “green” synthesis of PO-like PBAs using oxido-reductase flavocytochrome b2 is described in this study. When immobilized on graphite electrodes (GEs), the obtained green-synthesized PBAs or hexacyanoferrates (gHCFs) of transition and noble metals produced amperometric signals in response to H2 O2. HCFs of copper, iron, palladium and other metals were synthesized and characterized by structure, size, catalytic properties and electro-mediator activities. The gCuHCF, as the most effective PO mimetic with a flower-like micro/nano superstructure, was used as an H2 O2-sensitive platform for the development of a glucose oxidase (GO)-based biosensor. The GO/gCuHCF/GE biosensor exhibited high sensitivity (710 A M−1 m−2), a broad linear range and good selectivity when tested on real samples of fruit juices. We propose that the gCuHCF and other gHCFs synthesized via enzymes may be used as artificial POs in amperometric oxidase-based (bio)sensors. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) is one of the branches of fuel cells that can provide high potential for various applications. However, EBFC has challenges in improving the performance power output. Exploring electrode materials is one way to increase enzyme utilization and lead to a high conversion rate so that efficient enzyme loading on the electrode surface can function correctly. This paper briefly presents recent technologies developed to improve bio-catalytic properties, biocompatibility, biodegradability, implantability, and mechanical flexibility in EBFCs. Among the combinations of materials that can be studied and are interesting because of their properties, there are various nanoparticles, carbon-based materials, and conductive polymers; all three have the advantages of chemical stability and enhanced electron transfer. The methods to immobilize enzymes, and support and substrate issues are also covered in this paper. In addition, the EBFC system is also explored and developed as suitable for applications such as self-pumping and microfluidic EBFC. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - We describe a modification of the lactate biofuel cell to increase its capacity. A new multi-step enzyme reaction system without NAD was prepared using a bioanode modified with lactate oxidase, pyruvate decarboxylase, and pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase. Its operating time was 6 times longer than that of the biofuel cell using the lactate oxidase-modified bioanode at constant current measurement of 1mAcm 2 because of suppression of the diffusion overpotential due to the decrease in the fuel concentration. © 2021 Chemical Society of Japan.

AB  - Energy demand is increasing continuously due to the progress of industrialization, the vehicular population of the world, and modernization in lifestyle. In the present study, Chlorella minutissima microalgae were cultured in a 1500 L raceway open pond using commercial fertilizer under semi-continuous mode. About 19.98 wt % lipid was extracted by the soxhlet extraction method from this microalgae biomass. To optimize the input reaction parameters (temperature, lipid to methanol ratio, microwave power, and reaction time) for improving transesterification yield, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed. The output responses of the experiments were biodiesel yield along with density, kinematic viscosity, calorific value, cold flow properties, and oxidation stability. To validate the model, confirmation trials were carried out. All the fuel properties were found to be satisfying ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standard specifications except for oxidation stability at 3.0 h. The oxidation stability was further improved by using appropriate antioxidants and improved up to 10.5 h with the addition of 1000 ppm propyl gallate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We conducted ex-situ catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-CFP) of corn stalk (CS) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) over HZSM-5 catalyst to enhance the production of hydrocarbons. The effect of pyrolysis temperature and CS-to-HDPE mass ratio (CS/HDPE) on the yield of condensable volatile organic products (CVOPs) and the relative content of hydrocarbons were studied. The synergisms between CS and HDPE were determined based on the difference between the experimental and theoretical CVOP and hydrocarbons content. The results showed that the addition of HDPE significantly promotes the production of CVOPs, reaching the maximum value at 750 °C. In the presence of HZSM-5, the CVOP and hydrocarbons production, especially aromatics, were enhanced further, and 650 °C and 700 °C were the preferable pyrolysis temperature for desired products. Benzene, toluene, and xylenes were the predominant aromatics during the CFP process due to the good shape-selectivity of HZSM-5, contributing to the highest selectivity of C5–C11 compounds in C5+ hydrocarbons. CS/HDPE mass ratio of 1:1 was a critical point for enhancing aromatics yield. CS/HDPE < 1 was the recommended mass ratio for increasing the relative aromatic hydrocarbons content, which increases as the CS/HDPE mass ratio decreases. Meanwhile, we presented the potential reaction pathways between CS and HDPE to explain the synergistic effects during the co-CFP process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising feedstock for the synthesis of value-added chemicals and biofuels. However, one of the biggest challenges for producing high-quality diesel fuels is the lack of sufficient carbon-chain length in biomass derivatives. In this study, a C17 diesel precursor 1,1,1-tris(5-methyl-2-furyl)ethane (TEMF) with a yield of ca. 70% was synthesized from the cascade acetylation-hydroxyalkylation/alkylation of bio-based 2-methylfuran (MF) with acetic anhydride (AA) catalyzed by acid-treated montmorillonite with enhanced acidity and improved porosity. The catalytic mechanism of the cascade reaction process was investigated over different types of acid species (Brønsted acid and Lewis acid), and the influence of in situ formed acetic acid was also examined. A synergistic effect was observed to enable the synthesis of TEMF from the trimerization of MF with AA, in which Lewis acid and weak Brønsted acid species mainly catalyze the acetylation and hydroxyalkylation processes, while the subsequent alkylation step is mainly catalyzed by strong Brønsted acid. © 2020 The Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China, and Chemical Industry Press Co., Ltd

AB  - A greener processing route to replace the current environmentally-unfriendly esterification technique to produce biofuels such as pentyl valerate (PeVa) was explored. This study statistically optimized the covalent immobilization of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) onto biomass-based nanocellulose-silica (NC-SiO2) reinforced polyethersulfone (PES) membrane to synthesize PeVa. Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy of NC-SiO2-PES/CRL proved that CRL was successfully conjugated to the membrane. The optimized Taguchi Design-assisted immobilization of CRL onto NC-SiO2-PES membrane (5% glutaraldehyde, 4 h of immobilization, 20 mg/mL CRL concentration, 40 °C and pH 5) gave 90% yield of PeVa in 3 h. The thermal stability of NC-SiO2-PES/CRL was ~ 30% greater over the free CRL, with reusability for up to 14 successive esterification cycles. In a nutshell, the greener NC-SiO2-PES membrane effectively hyperactivated and stabilized the CRL for the esterification production of PeVa. This research provides a promising approach for expanding the use of sustainably sourced NC and SiO2 nanoparticles, as fillers in a PES for improving CRL activity and durability for an extended catalytic process.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the anaerobic granular sludge (AGS) as feedstock for hydrochar production using the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) process. HTC experiments were conducted at 250 °C for 2 h. The hydrochar produced was then co-pelletized with yard waste to produce densified biofuel pellets. The hydrochar yield was around 80%, while the hydrochar energy yield was around 93%. The calorific value of hydrochar increased to approximately 19 MJ/kg as compared to 16 MJ/kg for the raw AGS. HTC improved the combustion behavior of hydrochar by improving ignition and burnout temperatures. Hydrochar pellets were able to withstand the compressive force of 3.10 MPa as compared to 2.44 MPa by raw AGS pellets thus proving its enhanced robustness. This study demonstrated that combined HTC and pelletization could be integrated with the wastewater treatment plant for solid biofuel production from AGS, providing a valuable renewable energy source. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oleaginous biomass conversion to liquid hydrocarbon biofuels has emerged as an effective solution to the energy crisis and environmental problems. In this process, the removal of oxygenated compounds will directly affect the effectiveness of subsequent biofuel applications. Herein, deoxygenation of oleic acid by catalytic cracking was conducted using five various elements (La, Ni, P, Zr and Ce) modified Al-MCM-41. The related characterizations were carried out for these catalysts, including N2 physisorption, XRD, XPS, pyridine-FTIR and NH3-TPD techniques. The results showed the mesoporous structure of Al-MCM-41 was maintained after different modifications, and these catalysts greatly improved the hydrocarbons content and physiochemical properties of biofuels. The modified catalysts tended to facilitate the decarbonylation pathway and showed high selectivity to alkane and aromatic hydrocarbons. Besides, La/Al-MCM-41 presented excellent anti-coking activity. Ni/Al-MCM-41 showed both high dehydrogenation and deoxygenation activities. The Zr modification and Ce modification had a promotion effect in the deoxidizing activity of the catalyst, owing to the formation of oxophilic metal oxides. Noteworthily, P/Al-MCM-41 displayed the best deoxidizing performance due to its high Brönsted acidity, which caused the highest hydrocarbons content (82.30 %) and the lowest fatty acids content (around 0 %) of the biofuel. Moreover, the resulting biofuel had not only low oxygen content (3.88 wt.%) and acid value (5.47 mgKOH g−1) but also a high calorific value (44.50 MJ kg−1), which could be processed into green diesel. Hence, the catalytic cracking of fatty acid over P/Al-MCM-41 has excellent potential to produce high-quality renewable fuels. © 2021

AB  - Energy densification of biomass is usually done by pelletizing the raw biomass and then its torrefaction to obtain clean fuel from renewable resources. The objective of this study is to compare the untorrefied and torrefied pellets of two agricultural biomass residues as cotton waste (CW) and wheat straws (WS) with the different mixing ratios i.e., 100:0, 75:25, 25:75, 50:50, 0:100, respectively. Torrefaction of the pure biomass and their blending pellets were performed at 300 °C in a tube furnace at a heating rate of 10 °C/min with a residence time of 30 min. Characterization of untorrefied pellets showed slightly increase in carbon contents and its energy contents enhancement due to densification of the biomass residue owing to pelletization. Furthermore, its blends showed higher carbon content with the addition of cotton waste. Moreover, mass and energy yield data and Van Krevelon plot showed that the torrefied pellets with high CW to WS ratio specified even more rise in carbon contents and energy value due to high rate of devolatilization of hemicelluloses in CW residue. Finally, torrefaction severity index revealed that CW dictates its high degree of degradation as compared to WS which is an indication of high rate of hydrogen and oxygen loss and resulting enhancement in carbon content. Experimental results showed increased values of carbon contents and energy contents, which shows significant synergistic effect of blending and torrefaction to produce carbon rich solid biofuel. As a result carbon contents and calorific value of blended 25% WS + 75%CW torrefied pellets increased from 41.5 % to 64.84 % and 18.322 MJ/Kg to 28.5 MJ/K g respectively, similarly energy yield and torrefaction index showed higher values of 91.67 % and 1.379 respectively compared to untorrefied pellets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, the pyrolysis characteristics of waste clay oil were studied using thermogravimetric and reaction kinetic analysis. Additionally, the two temperature stages in the pyrolysis process of waste clay oil were analyzed. Furthermore, Py-GC-MS was used to analyze the main products of cracked volatiles at different pyrolysis temperatures, it showed that the higher pyrolysis temperature was beneficial to promote the decarboxylation reaction in the pyrolysis reaction. Also, it suggested the probable occurrence of cyclization reaction during the pyrolysis process. Based on the pyrolysis characteristics of waste clay oil, a fixed bed rapid pyrolysis experiment was carried out to explore the properties of pyrolysis products. Subsequently, the pyrolysis products of waste clay oil were analyzed by means of FTIR, NMR, GC-MS and GC-TCD/FID. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Integration of the biorefinery concept to the existing Kraft-pulping process is undertaken to achieve a more sustainable development. This paper aims at developing a novel biorefinery-integrated-Kraft-pulping network with improved profitability, energy self-sufficiency and minimum CO2 emission by employing technologies consisting of biofuel and biochemical productions, biomass gasification together with CO2 capture and utilization. Three scenarios, including (I) the production of gasification-based dimethyl ether (DME); (II) the co-production of DME and succinic acid; and (III) the co-production of DME and succinic acid coupled with the CO2 utilization, have been investigated. Among all scenarios, Scenario II exhibits the best economic performances as highlighted by the 74% increase of profit compared to the conventional process. Scenario III achieves the highest energy efficiency at 39% and an improved environmental performance due to the 65% reduction of CO2 emission compared to the conventional process with only 0.7% profit reduction. Comparing to the biorefinery-integrated-Soda-pulping networks proposed by the previous work, the biorefinery-integrated-Kraft-pulping networks show higher performance on both economic and environmental improvements. Thereby confirming that the integration of the biorefinery network can improve the sustainability and enhance the economic benefit of the Kraft-pulping process beyond the conventional process. © 2021

AB  - Electro-fermentation system (EFS) emerges its effectiveness on treating microalgae for biodiesel production, but much is unknown about biodegradation behaviors, biodiesel characteristics, and microbial community. Compared with conventional fermentation system (CFS), microbial electrolysis cell-based EFS (MEC-EFS) and microbial fuel cell-based EFS (MFC-EFS) were investigated for the performance while treating microalgae Nannochloropsis sp. Results indicated that MEC-EFS presented much higher first-order decomposition rate coefficients of carbohydrates and proteins (1.212/d and 0.951/d) than those of CFS (0.615/d and 0.794/d) and MFC-EFS (0.518/d and 0.415/d). Compared with MFC-EFS, MEC-EFS showed better electrochemical performance (2.17 A/m3 vs. 0.95 A/m3). Moreover, MEC-EFS reached the highest extracted lipid to biomass ratio (43.3%), followed by MFC-EFS (32.3%) and CFS (27.7%). By strengthened microbial biohydrogenation, MEC-EFS and MFC-EFS had higher saturated fatty acids ratio (78.8% and 70.6%) than that of CFS (56.1%). For MEC-EFS, enriched Ruminococcus and Geobacter in anodic biofilm might contribute to favorable biohydrogenation and electrochemical performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Carbon monoxide (CO) is a highly valuable component of syngas which could be used to synthesize various chemicals and fuels. Conventionally, syngas is derived from fossil-based natural gas and coal which are non-renewable. To curb the problem, CO2 gasification offers a win-win solution in which CO2 is converted with wastes to CO, achieving carbon emission mitigation and addressing waste disposal issue simultaneously. In this review, gasification of various wastes by CO2 with particular focus given to generation of CO-rich syngas is presented and critically discussed. This includes the effects of operating parameters (temperature, pressure and physicochemical properties of feedstocks) and advanced CO2 gasification techniques (catalytic CO2 gasification, CO2 co-gasification and microwave-driven CO2 gasification). Furthermore, associated technological challenges are highlighted and way forward in this field are proposed. Summary of main finding: This article provides a comprehensive review on the current state-of-the-art CO2 gasification technology for CO-rich syngas production. Effects of process parameters, feedstock properties, advanced CO2 gasification techniques are critically reviewed and presented, as well as technical challenges and way forward towards commercialization of the technology are highlighted and proposed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An integrated biorefinery concept for yeast-based biodiesel production using durian peel (DP) as a feedstock was developed. After dilute acid hydrolysis, DP hydrolysate (DPH) and DP solid fraction (DPSF) hydrolysis residues were generated. Yeast lipid was produced from undetoxified DPH by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa KKUSY14. DPSF was subjected to a one-step sulfonation process to prepare a solid catalyst (DPSF-SO3H) and was characterized using FTIR, XRD, and FE-SEM analysis. DPSF-SO3H catalyst exhibited good catalytic activity for yeast-based biodiesel (FAME) production from wet cell of KKUSY14 grown in DPH by direct transesterification. FAME yields of 81.57% and 78.73% were reached, respectively, for microwave and conventional heating. The fuel properties of FAME were in accordance with the ASTM and EN standards. Based on the higher heating value of FAME produced, an energy output of about 32.44–34.90 MJ/kg was estimated. The proposed bio-refinery concept led to the production of 101.2 kg yeast biomass, 16.0 kg yeast lipid, 717 kg DPSF-SO3H catalyst, 79.7–82.6 kg FAME, and 70.4 kg yeast residues from 1000 kg of DP waste. This model clearly provides economic benefits by creating value-added products and eliminating any waste streams. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to over-consumption of fossil resources and environmental problems, lignocellulosic biomass as the most abundant and renewable materials is considered as the best candidate to produce biomaterials, biochemicals, and bioenergy, which is of strategic significance and meets the theme of Green Chemistry. Highly efficient and green fractionation of lignocellulose components significantly boosts the high-value utilization of lignocellulose and the biorefinery development. However, heterogeneity of lignocellulosic structure severely limited the lignocellulose fractionation. This paper offers the summary and perspective of the extensive investigation that aims to give insight into the lignocellulose prior-fractionation. Based on the role and structure of lignocellulose component in the plant cell wall, lignocellulose prior-fractionation can be divided into cellulose-first strategy, hemicelluloses-first strategy, and lignin-first strategy, which realizes the selective dissociation and transformation of a component in lignocellulose. Ultimately, the challenges and opportunities of lignocellulose prior-fractionation are proposed on account of the existing problems in the biorefining valorization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - These studies focuses on synthesizing of an efficient CaO-based-catalyst derived from the binary mixture of Lattorina littorea (periwinkles shell) and Mactra coralline (seashell), and apply it to transesterification of a quaternary mix of Carica papaya - Citrus sinesis- Hibiscus sabdariffa- Waste used. Details characterization of the developed catalyst was carried out using SEM, FTIR, and XRD to establish its catalytic potential. Process parameters optimization for the transesterification process was carried out to determine the optimum yield of biodiesel from oil blend. Lattorina littorea and Mactra coralline were made into powder by milling after drying, the powdered were mixed in the same ratio to obtain a developed catalyst before characterization. Oil was extracted from Carica papaya, Citrus sinesis, Hibiscus sabdariffa seed powder through solvent extraction method, the extracted oil was mixed in quaternary ratio with waste used oil, the properties of the mixed oil was determined before the transesterification with ethanol. Process optimization was carried using response surface methodology (RSM) coupled with central composite design (CCD) by considering four independent variables (reaction time, derived calcined catalyst powder (DCCP) amount, reaction temperature, and EtOH/OMR). The catalyst recyclability test was carried out, and the biodiesel quality was determined through physicochemical properties. The results showed 25:25:25:25 quaternary blend produced oil with low viscous and high volatility. Thermal treatment of a developed catalyst (DP) from Lattorina littorea mix with Mactra coralline, at 900 °C for 3 h produced CaO of 99.02 (% wt.) on XRD analysis result. The produced catalyst developed was re-used up to 3–cycles for base transesterification. The maximum experimental yield of 99.95 (% wt.) at a reaction time of 60 min, DCCP amount of 3.0 (g), reaction temperature of 70 °C, and EtOH/OMR of 6:1 (ml/ml), was obtained, but the statistical optimization predicted biodiesel yield of 99.8044 (wt. %) at a reaction time of 57.72 min, DCCP amount of 3.0 (g), reaction temperature of 69.54 °C, and EtOH/OMR of 6:1 (ml/ml), this yield was validated in triplicate and an average biodiesel yield of 99.7800 (%wt.) was obtained. Analysis of variance and the p-value showed that the selected variable factors were remarkably significant (p-value&lt;0.0001). Based on fit statistics and model comparison statistics, the coefficient of determination (R squared) of 99.84% was obtained with the predicted R2 of 99.06 in reasonable agreement with the adjusted R2 of 99.68. The quality of biodiesel produced was within the specification limits of biodiesel standard. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and H2 were produced from sesame cake in supercritical mixture of methanol and water using alumina supported CaO and MgO nanoparticles. The fresh and used catalysts were characterized by ICP-OES, BET, XRD, and TEM techniques. The significant influence of catalysts on the gas production was revealed. Further, the highest amounts of H2, CO, and CO2 was achieved by MgO/γ-Al2O3 with the hydrogen fraction more than 7.6 times, compared with the non-catalytic process. For biodiesel, CaO/γ-Al2O3 showed the best performance where 35.3% of the liquid product was FAMEs, more than 2.3 times relative to the non-catalytic process. In order to reduce the amounts of nitrogenate content in the liquid fuel, an efficient and scalable method implemented with the Soxhlet apparatus and the absorption tube equipped with CO2 gas flow system. Accordingly, the N-contents of the liquid products were reduced to highest degree of 65.2%, asserting that the reduced amount of the N-content strongly depends on the catalyst during the production process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The transesterification of triglycerides is a critical step in biodiesel production. In this work, by loading boron-doped copper oxides onto SBA-15 mesoporous molecular sieve, an acid-base bifunctional catalyst (i.e., CunO-Bs/SBA-15) was prepared and applied to triglyceride transesterification. Compared with pure copper, sodium or boron oxides-based catalysts, CunO-Bs/SBA-15 enabled a higher biodiesel yield (>97.5%) at near room temperature (i.e., 40 °C) in 120 min. The characterization results showed that after B doping, the CunO-Bs/SBA-15 catalyst contained highly-dispersed acid-base sites without blocking the channels of porous SBA-15 support, which had good catalytic performance. Finally, in-situ DRIFTS was used to reveal the catalytic mechanism of the acid-base bifunctional groups of the as-prepared CunO-Bs/SBA-15 during transesterification. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study provides insight into the decolorization strategy for crude glycerol obtained from biodiesel production using waste cooking oil as raw material. A sequential procedure that includes physico-chemical treatment and adsorption using activated carbon from oil palm biomass was investigated. The results evidenced decolorization and enrichment of glycerol go hand in hand during the treatment, achieving &gt;89% color removal and &gt; 98% increase in glycerol content, turning the glycerol into a clear (colorless) solution. This is attributed to the complete removal of methanol, free fatty acids, and triglycerides, as well as 85% removal of water, and 93% removal of potassium. Properties of the resultant glycerol met the quality standard of BS 2621:1979. The economic aspects of the proposed methods are examined to fully construct a predesign budgetary estimation according to chemical engineering principles. The starting capital is proportionate to the number of physical assets to acquire where both entail a considerable cost at USD 13,200. Having the benefit of sizeable scale production, it reasonably reduces the operating cost per unit product. As productivity sets at 33 m3 per annum, the annual operating costs amount to USD 79,902 in glycerol decolorization. This is translatable to USD 5.38 per liter glycerol, which is ~69% lower compared to using commercial activated carbon. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Catalytic cracking of triglycerides over nanosized ZSM-5 (Nano-ZSM-5) and hierarchical ZSM-5 materials namely mesoporous ZSM-5 (Meso-ZSM-5) and nanosized ZSM-5/SBA-15 analog composite (Com-ZSM-5) was evaluated under fluid catalytic cracking conditions aiming to reduce the concentration of aromatics, especially benzene in the gasoline stream. The catalytic experiments were performed in a Single-Receiver Short-Contact-Time Microactivity Test unit (SR-SCT-MAT, Grace Davison) at 500 °C, catalyst-to-oil ratios of 0.3–1.0 (w/w) and contact time of 12 s. It was shown that the reduction of the ZSM-5 crystal size to nanometer (Nano-ZSM-5) or introduction of hierarchical porosity in ZSM-5 crystals (Meso-ZSM-5 and Com-ZSM-5) indeed improved the quality of gasoline by lowering the content of aromatics, particularly benzene. Compared to commercial ZSM-5, Meso-ZSM-5 and Nano-ZSM-5 produced more gasoline hydrocarbons while lowering the benzene content to ca. 2.0%, a relative decrease by ca. 50%. The advantage of Com-ZSM-5 over Meso-ZSM-5 and Nano-ZSM-5 was the lowest benzene level, i.e. ca. 0.8% which was below the permitted limit of less than 1% specified by the European regulation. The improved molecular transport along with the reduced density of strong Brønsted acid sites provided by the nanocrystalline and hierarchical ZSM-5 catalysts might be responsible for their superior catalytic performance. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) is an attractive oxidoreductase for bioelectrochemical applications. Its two-domain structure allows the flavoheme enzyme to establish direct electron transfer to biosensor and biofuel cell electrodes. Yet, the application of CDH in these devices is impeded by its limited stability under turnover conditions. In this work, we aimed to improve the turnover stability of CDH by semirational, high-throughput enzyme engineering. We screened 13 736 colonies in a 96-well plate setup for improved turnover stability and selected 11 improved variants. Measures were taken to increase the reproducibility and robustness of the screening setup, and the statistical evaluation demonstrates the validity of the procedure. The selected CDH variants were expressed in shaking flasks and characterized in detail by biochemical and electrochemical methods. Two mechanisms contributing to turnover stability were found: (i) replacement of methionine side chains prone to oxidative damage and (ii) the reduction of oxygen reactivity achieved by an improved balance of the individual reaction rates in the two CDH domains. The engineered CDH variants hold promise for the application in continuous biosensors or biofuel cells, while the deduced mechanistic insights serve as a basis for future enzyme engineering approaches addressing the turnover stability of oxidoreductases in general. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - A new approach for biogas slurry disposal was put forward in this study through converting biogas slurry to the organic fertilizer of Spathiphyllum. The biogas slurry was firstly concentrated by vacuum distillation to reduce its volume by 80% who is called 5CBS, and then CO2 saturated to reduce its pH to about 6.50 ± 0.20. With or without adding the exogenetic Ca, Mg and P nutrients, CO2-rich 5CBS (i.e., CR-5CBS) was adopted as the root or foliar fertilizer to cultivate Spathiphyllum. Additionally, the commercial Spathiphyllum fertilizer was also experimented as a control. Results showed that the cases adopting CR-5CBS as the root or foliar fertilizer can obtain the agronomic traits and ornamental values of Spathiphyllum better those irrigated by the commercial fertilizer. Exogenetic nutrients added into CR-5CBS can lead to a decreased dead leaf number of Spathiphyllum, an enhanced N assimilation performance, however only a slightly improved assimilation performance of Ca, Mg and P. In terms of the fertilizer economy, CR-5CBS without exogenetic nutrient addition may be a promising for replacing the commercial Spathiphyllum fertilizer in the future. Economic and environmental pollution potential (EPP) analyses indicated that treating biogas slurry as the organic flower fertilizer can achieve a high net profit with about $ 28.89/m3-biogas slurry and a negative EPP value (−3.9), showing its profitability and environmental friendliness. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The processing of duckweed has been included in the list of promising pathways for biofuels production. This property is attributed to its simple manual harvesting method and its ability for high protein or starch content, depending on its species and growing environment. The biofuels production from duckweed, is not only a solution to energy and environmental problems, but also a reliable way to realize the utilization of duckweed. This critical review focuses on the bio-oil production from duckweed via pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction processes. First, characteristics and eco-environmental benefits of duckweed are reviewed. Next, the impacts of different parameters on the properties and distribution of bio-oil from pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction are discussed in detail. Subsequently, the effect of hydrogen donor solvents (as reaction media for upgrading) and catalysts on the upgrading of duckweed bio-oil are extensively discussed. This paper ends with the prospects for further development in thermochemical valorization of duckweed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Light-dependent enzymes are a rare type of biocatalyst with high potential for research and biotechnology. A recently discovered fatty acid photo-decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A (CvFAP) converts fatty acids to the corresponding hydrocarbons only when irradiated with blue light (400 to 520 nm). To expand the available catalytic diversity for fatty acid decarboxylation, we reconstructed possible ancestral decarboxylases from a set of 12 extant sequences that were classified under the fatty acid decarboxylases clade within the glucose-methanol choline (GMC) oxidoreductase family. One of the resurrected enzymes (ANC1) showed activity in the decarboxylation of fatty acids, showing that the clade indeed contains several photo-decarboxylases. ANC1 has a 15 °C higher melting temperature (Tm) than the extant CvFAP. Its production yielded 12-fold more protein than this wild type decarboxylase, which offers practical advantages for the biochemical investigation of this photoenzyme. Homology modelling revealed amino acid substitutions to more hydrophilic residues at the surface and shorter flexible loops compared to the wild type. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction, we have expanded the existing pool of confirmed fatty acid photo-decarboxylases, providing access to a more robust catalyst for further development via directed evolution. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - This study used the subcritical hydrothermal liquefaction technique (SHLT) in the co-liquefaction of process rejects at a wastepaper-based paper mill (PRWPM) and waste soybean oil (WSO) for the production of biofuels and bio-char material. PRWPM emits complicated waste composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and plastic from sealing film. The waste is produced from the recycled paper process of a mill plant located in central Taiwan. The source of WSO is the rejected organic waste from a cooking oil factory located in north Taiwan. PRWPM and WSO are suitable for use as fuels, but due to their high oxygen content, their use as commercial liquid fuels is not frequent, thus making deoxygenation and hydrogenation necessary. The temperature and pressure of SHLT were set at 523–643 K and 40–250 bar, respectively. The experimental conditions included solvent ratios of oil–water, temperature, reaction time, and ratios of solvent to PRWPM. The analysis results contained approximated components, heating values, elements, surface features, simulated distillations, product compositions, and recovery yields. The HHV of the product occurred at an oil–water ratio of 75:25, with a value of 38.04 MJ kg−1 . At an oil–water ratio of 25:75, the liquid oil-phase product of SHTL has the highest heating value 42.02 MJ kg−1 . Higher WSO content implies a lower heating value of the oil-phase product. The simulated distillation result of the oil-phase product with higher content of alcohol and alkanes obtained at the oil–water ratio of 25:75 is better than the other ratios. Here, the carbon number of the oil product is between C8–C36. The product conversion rate rises with an increase of the WSO ratio. It is proved that blending soybean oil with water can significantly enhance the quality of liquefied oil and the conversion rate of PRWPM. Therefore, the solid and liquid biomass wastes co-liquefaction to produce gas and liquid biofuels under SHLT are quite feasible. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Such experiments allow efficient extraction of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and other valuable chemical substances, such as glycolic acid and acetic acid, from the lignocellulosic biomass. These compounds and their decomposition products present in the samples after HTL are analyzed and quantified using spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. In general, the relatively higher-pressure nitrogen atmospheric condition is more suitable for obtaining the desired products, relative to the air atmosphere. Based on the quantitative results, the optimal temperatures for producing acetic acid, glycolic acid, and HMF are 300 °C, 250 °C, and 180 °C, respectively. The interesting relationship between HMF yield and temperature is also discussed; as the temperature increases, the yield of HMF first decreases and then increases. This phenomenon is explained by the exothermic nature of the HMF decomposition reaction, which is inhibited by excessively high temperature (in the range from 380 to 425 °C). At moderately high temperatures (optimized conditions; 300 °C), the generation rate of HMF exceeds its decomposition rate, resulting in a high yield of HMF. Based on the results of the experiments conducted in this study, the decomposition mechanism describing HTL treatment of wood chips can be elucidated. This study therefore provides guidance for future work involving HMF extraction from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Microalgae are valuable biological resources for application in the fields of food, feed, fuel, and therapeutics. Recently, their usage was extended for their efficacy in bioremediation of pollutants. In this context, the degradation of used motor oil (UMO) and biodiesel production was performed with the freshwater microalgae Coelastrella sp. M60 and Scenedesmus sp. VJ1. Both microalgae were inoculated into a blue-green 11 medium with different concentrations of UMO as carbon source. The obtained results indicated that microalgae grown in 5 % UMO yielded the maximum lipid content compared to the control and other treatments. TiO2 was selected as heterogeneous catalyst to examine the fatty acid methyl ester profile of the obtained lipid. The biodegradation of UMO by two different microalgae was also evaluated using GC-MS analysis. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Green biofuels are potential suggested solutions to pollutant emission issues and society's dependence on fossil derivatives for some time. Ethanol and biodiesel are renewable commercial fuels that are candidates for substituting fossil sources, especially in diesel engines, which are typically more efficient than spark-ignition engines. Ternary blends of diesel, biodiesel, and Ethanol form partial diesel replacement strategies applicable to diesel engines without the need for major adaptations. In this study, experimental evaluations were carried out in a multi-cylindrical diesel engine, supplied with diesel blends, Chlorella Vulgaris algae biodiesel (up to 20% in volumetric content), and anhydrous Ethanol (up to 20% in volumetric content). Each ternary blend is composed of different alcohol proportions and always with a volumetric concentration of 1% of a blend stabilizing additive. Therefore, the tests associate partial substitutions of diesel for biofuels with evaluations of engine performance and combustion of the blends under some load conditions, rotation regimes, and fuel injection instants. However, the search for optimized instants in fuel injection brought improvements to the engine's performance, allowed more advantageous energy conversions from Ethanol in diesel compared to spark ignition, in addition to minimizing the effects of Ethanol in delaying the beginning of combustion. To determine the effects of different ethanol proportions on efficiency when the CI engine is supplied with DBE mixtures, specific conditions of rotation, torque, and fuel injection moments were considered in the tests’ planning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy dense liquid biofuels are needed where direct electrification is infeasible, such as the heavy-transports sector. A novel flexible methanol production unit with highly integrated solid oxide cells, characterized by five operating modes, is compared with two non-flexible units from a techno-economic perspective. The aim is to investigate whether a more complex flexible methanol production facility that is able to both store and produce electricity could be cost-competitive with single-mode solutions, by ensuring a higher capacity factor. The flexible solution has the highest capital cost (620 M$2019), followed by the so-called electricity storage single-mode unit (490 M$2019) and the conventional unit (390 M$2019). Decomposition of the methanol production costs shows that electricity and biomass are the major cost factors. The minimum fuel selling price is generally lowest for the conventional unit (92–117 $/MWhth), followed by the electricity storage single-mode unit (87–127 $/MWhth), and the flexible system (93–125 $/MWhth). Flexibility is generally not a key-strength for the flexible unit, as the increased investment cost associated to a major complexity represents a disadvantage. However, flexibility becomes relevant when imposing constraints on the use of electricity produced from fossil fuels to produce methanol, since it ensures higher capacity factor and methanol yield. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, various metal-modified zeolite beta-based catalysts such as La(10)zeo(90), Co(10)zeo(90), Fe(10)zeo(90), Mg(10)zeo(90), Mn(10)zeo(90) and Zn(10)zeo(90) were investigated in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of oleic acid (OA) to produce renewable diesel. The La(10)zeo(90) catalyst showed a conversion of OA up to 99 % with 83 % C15 and C17 selectivity after the reaction at 350 °C for 2 h under 4 MPa H2 pressure. The superior activity of La(10)zeo(90) was attributed to the synergistic interaction between La-Si-Al, a sufficient amount of weak + medium acid sites and excellent textural properties (large pore diameter). Larger pore diameter of La(10)zeo(90) is highly desirable as it will generate greater diffusion of bulky molecules, thereby improving the accessibility of the reactant and hence excellent catalytic activity. The vacuum distillation was used to purify the crude liquid product (CLP), producing high-quality diesel fractions mainly comprising C14, C15, and C17 fractions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study shows biomethane production in a novel two-stage syngas biomethanation consisting of the thermophilic anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge combined with an injection of syngas as the first stage. Since the syngas does not contain enough reducing equivalents, the produced biogas was connected to the second stage consisting of the trickle-bed reactor with the external H2 addition (ex-situ) to increase the CH4 content further. The aim was to evaluate the influence of different syngas compositions on the biomethane production in both stages. The results showed that H2 concentration in syngas is the main factor affecting the CH4 content in biogas. Moreover, the ex-situ reactor with H2 addition served to convert the residual CO and CO2, achieving the maximum CH4 content of 94.7% in the produced biomethane. In summary, the two-stage process enables biomethane production without any inhibitory effects on anaerobic sludge digestion. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Antibiotic fermentation residue (AR) is composed of hazardous organic waste produced by the pharmaceutical industry. AR can be effectively converted into bio-oil by fast pyrolysis, but its high nitrogen content limits the prospect of bio-oil as a fuel resource. In order to further reduce the nitrogen content of AR bio-oil, we have examined the catalytic removal of N and O from penicillin fermentation residue (PR) bio-oil under fast pyrolysis conditions. We have used M/HZSM-5 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr, Mo, Ag and Ce) metal catalysts, with a metal oxide content of 10%. Additionally, the effect of mixed and separated catalytic forms on catalytic upgrading were analyzed, and changes in the catalyst itself before and after pyrolysis under separated catalytic conditions were specifically investigated. Our results show that the metal elements in the fresh catalyst will exist in the form of oxides, ions and simple metals. In-situ reduction caused by pyrolysis gas in the catalytic pyrolysis process makes some ionic metals (e.g., Co2+, Cu2+ and Ag+) in the catalyst transform into oxides, and some metal oxides are reduced to simple metals or suboxides (including Fe, Ni, Cu and Mo). The N content in the mixed catalytic bio-oil decreased from 10.09 wt% to Zn/HZSM-5 (6.98 wt%), Co/HZSM-5 (7.1 wt%), Cu/HZSM-5 (7.18 wt%) and Ce/HZSM-5 (7.18 wt%). We also observed significant reduction in the O content (9.77 wt%) with Ag/HZSM-5 (3.75 wt%), Mo/HZSM-5 (6.86 wt%), Ce/HZSM-5 (8.39 wt%) and Fe/HZSM-5 (8.54 wt%) in the separated catalytic bio-oil. The Ni/HZSM-5 catalystcan reduce the organic acid content in bio-oil from 22.9% to 10.8%. The separated catalysis methodology also promoted an increase of hydrocarbons in the bio-oil: Zn/HZSM-5, Ag/HZSM-5, Mo/HZSM-5, Zr/HZSM-5 and Ce/HZSM-5 reached 11.6%, 11.5%, 11.1%, 10.1%, and 8.8%, respectively. Carbon deposition formed by aromatic carbon/graphite carbon, pyrrole and pyridine compounds leads to deactivation of the catalyst. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ca riched Hydrotalcite like compounds (HLCs) were synthesized by co-precipitation method to obtained Ca–Mg–Al mixed metal oxides with a view to produce biodiesel via methanolysis of microalgae. For this purpose, hydrotalcite-like catalysts containing Ca+2, Mg+2 and Al+3 metals were prepared with a molar ratio (x value) of Al+3/(Ca+2 + Mg+2 + Al+3) at 0.33. Ca/Mg molar ratio in the hydrotalcite like compounds was determined as 0, 0.5, 1, 2. Also, Mg-free CaAl HLCs was prepared at x = 0.33 value. The calcination process was carried out at 800 °C. Obtained catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, TGA, FTIR, SEM and ICP-OES techniques. The basicity of the all catalysts were investigated by using TPD/CO2 technique and Hammett indicators. With increase in calcium amount on the HLCs, some evident features were observed such as high basicity and increase in basicity range with H_ values above 15, increase in pore diameter up to 18.37 nm, low pore volume and high catalytic activities. XRD analysis demostrated that the desired Ca–Mg–Al active metal oxide forms were formed after calcination. Catalytic activities of all the catalysts were examined in terms of conversion of microalgae oil to biodiesel and achieved up to 90% FAME yield under mild reaction conditions: 338 K for 5 h, methanol/microalgae oil molar ratio 6:1 and 3% catalyst amount. These results showed that the molar ratio of Ca–Mg in HLCs were significantly effective on the HLCs structure and catalytic activity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lipase-mediated transesterification is a greener method for renewable biodiesel production, which can maintain high-level purity of the end products compared to the chemical transesterification methods. Hence, in this study, lipase was produced indigenously using Solid State Fermentation (SSF) from Rhizopus oryzae NRRL 3562, which was further immobilized on activated celite for transesterification. The evaluation of various transesterification attributes and stepwise optimizations were carried out for two different feedstock lipids, viz., a unialgal culture of Chlorella minutissima MCC 27, and a phyco-myco co-culture of C. minutissima MCC 27 and Aspergillus awamori. The optimal conditions, viz., 1:3–1:4 oil:methanol (molar ratio), 15 U lipase, 35 °-40 °C reaction temperature, 1% initial water loading, 1:0.4–1:0.6 substrate:hexane (w/v), 200–250 rpm agitation speed, and 30 h reaction duration ensued 91.52–93.25% fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) conversions in the selected microbial strains. The spent lipase showed potential for cyclic use and was found to have upheld almost 90% residual activity at the end of the 5th cycle. The two resultant biodiesels showed comparable fuel properties except a marginal alleviation in density, viscosity, and iodine value in case of C. minutissima MCC 27 and A. awamori co-culture biodiesel compared to C. minutissima biodiesel. © 2021

AB  - Catalytic esterification of fatty acids, such as oleic acid, is one of the most important chemical pathways for producing biofuels, and attention is now focused on looking for heterogeneous catalysts to avoid the defects of homogeneous catalysts. With this approach, an efficient Lewis acidic catalyst, Fe2(MoO4)3, was successfully prepared with definite crystalline morphology to catalyze the esterification reaction of oleic acid together with ethanol. Under optimum conditions (70 °C, 9 alcohol: 1 oleic molar ratio and 3% catalyst amount), the catalytic conversion of oleic acid to biodiesel was 90.5% and 92.5 in case of 5% catalyst, indicating that the combined catalyst has good catalytic activity. The kinetic study of ethanol–oleic acid esterification was conducted, as the kinetic study follows first-order kinetics with the calculated activation energy Ea = 25.21 kJ mol−1 and pre-exponential factor A0 = 2449.16 min−1. Thermodynamic showed a positive value of ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG (endothermic reaction). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Current study was designed for developing the novel nano-biocatalyst (Lipase-PDA-TiO2 NPs) for enzymatic transesterification of Jatropha curcas seed oil (JCSO). The TiO2 NPs were prepared by the hydrothermal method and were afterward modified by the polydopamine (PDA) polymer. The synthesized nanomaterial was characterized by SEM, FTIR, XRD and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Lipase activity assay was used to check the stability of immobilized enzyme under varying conditions of pH and temperature. Transesterification of JCSO using Lipase-PDA-TiO2 NPs catalyst was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Optimum biodiesel yield (92%) was achieved by carrying out the transesterification process for 30 h at 37 °C temperature with 10% nano-biocatalyst concentration, 6:1 methanol:oil ratio and 0.5% water content. On the basis of model significance, R2 value, lack of fit test and predicted vs. actual values, quadratic model was selected as the best fitted model. The FTIR technique was utilized to monitor the transesterification process. The comparison of the physiochemical characteristics of the synthesized biodiesel with the international standard for bio-fuel affirms that the transesterification of JCSO in the presence of the nano-biocatalyst provides an effective alternative for the production of biodiesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Residues of açaí seeds (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) were a novel source for the synthesis of the acid heterogeneous catalyst applied in the conversion of low free fatty acid waste cooking oil (WCO) to biodiesel. Yield of activated carbon (AC) and catalyst (CAT), as well as density of SO3H groups and total acidity, was analyzed in an entirely random designed experiment using multiple linear regression, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey’s post hoc test. Time, temperature, dosage of KOH, and ratio of H2SO4/AC were the predictor variables with 3 levels each, at a significance level of α =.05. A significant yield variation portion of AC was explained by the experimental factors (R2 =.891, F (3, 23) = 62.9, p &lt;.0001), as did the yield of CAT (R2 =.960, F (3, 23) = 185.7, p &lt;.0001), density of SO3H (R2 =.969, F (3, 23) = 242.2, p &lt;.0001), and total acidity (R2 =.973, F (3, 23) = 280.6, p &lt;.0001). Levels of time (p =.001) and KOH dosage (p =.006) were significant to the yield of AC, and temperature levels were not influent on density of SO3H (p =.731) or total acidity (p =.762). CAT showed a SBET of 249 m2 g−1, Vpore of 0.104 cm3 g−1, low crystallinity, high thermal stability, and a mesoporous amorphous structure. Optimized catalytic tests resulted in 89% conversion of WCO and 11 cycles of reuse, better than pure H2SO4 or pure KOH (p &lt;.0001) and also better than many biomass-derived catalysts reported in the literature. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biodiesel produced from non-edible oils has received intensive attention in recent years. Herein, a series of novel amphipathic ionic liquids (ILs) based on the 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) were prepared for the transesterification of soapberry oil and methanol. The structures of the prepared ILs were systematically characterized by both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR). In addition, the effects of side-chain length of cation and the number of active site (H+) of ILs on the biodiesel yield were investigated, and the results suggested that 1-dodecyl-(4-dimethylammonium)-pyridinium bisulfate ([C12-DMAPH][HSO4]2) exhibited the highest catalytic efficiency. Meanwhile, [C12-DMAPH][HSO4]2 was proven to be amphipathic, and the corresponding catalytic mechanism was proposed. Under the catalysis of [C12-DMAPH][HSO4]2, the optimum operating conditions of transesterification of soapberry oil and methanol were explored via the combination of single factor experiment and response surface methodology, obtaining the high biodiesel yield of (98.02 ± 0.36)% under the optimum operating conditions. Importantly, [C12-DMAPH][HSO4]2 exhibited high stability in the transesterification of soapberry oil and methanol in five consecutive runs. Furthermore, the catalytic activities of [C12-DMAPH][HSO4]2 towards other transesterification of non-edible oils and lower alcohols were also investigated, which indicated a general applicability of the prepared IL. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Acetalization of glycerol into solketal, a potential fuel additive, is a promising approach to utilizing the large waste-stream of glycerol from the biodiesel industry. Herein, we report an efficient ultrasound-assisted room temperature synthesis of solketal by acetalization of glycerol with acetone using an easily recoverable sulfonic acid-functionalized, silica-coated Fe3O4magnetic nanoparticle (Fe3O4@SiO2@SO3H MNP, FSS MNP) catalyst. The morphology, chemical composition and magnetic properties of the catalyst were elucidated. The acetalization of glycerol was carried out under ultrasonication at room temperature, resulting in 97% glycerol conversion after 15 minutes and 95% isolated yield of solketal with 100% selectivity for this acetal. The facile magnetic retrievability of the catalyst imparted operational simplicity to the solketal synthetic protocol, avoiding complicated catalyst separation and product purification processes. The FSS catalyst was magnetically recycled for up to five catalytic experiments, maintaining a glycerol conversion of 95% and without deterioration in its selectivity, composition, morphology or magnetic properties, thereby ameliorating the green aspects of the protocol. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Although challenging, the generation of energy through the harvesting of electrons from biological fluids via fuel cells is a promising technology for wearable electronics. However, a current challenge is that neither a single molecular catalyst or an enzyme can completely oxidize fuels in biological fluids. With this issue in mind, herein, we report a hybrid bi-catalytic system allowing complete lactate oxidation by combining an organic catalyst, 4-amino-TEMPO (Amino-TEMPO), with a recombinant enzyme, oxalate decarboxylase (OxDc). This hybrid system was chosen due to the high oxidative catalytic activity of the molecular catalyst and the promiscuity of the recombinant enzyme to alternative substrates. The hybrid architecture enhanced the performance of the bioanode, enabling higher efficiency and improved stability of the energy-harvesting fuel cell. The hybrid system showed high catalytic activity, achieving a high and stable current density of 23.0 ± 1.5 mA cm−2 for lactate oxidation after 48 h of bulk electrolysis. Intermediate and product analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography (GC) coupled to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) confirmed that the hybrid architecture acts in the multiples catabolic steps of lactate oxidation, enabling the complete oxidation of lactate to CO2 by collecting 12 electrons from the fuel molecule. © 2021

AB  - Negative emissions technologies (NETs), which remove and isolate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, are expected to play a significant role in mitigating climate change. As one of the most promising NETs, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) methods, which captures carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from bioenergy plants and then stores them in geological reservoirs, are being widely used in climate change scenarios. With the increased focus on mitigating solutions, several concerns have been raised regarding the deployment of BECCS. As no science mapping analyses of evolutionary BECCS patterns have yet been made, this study sought to determine these evolution patterns using a systematic analysis approach based on science mapping and visualization analyses. Under a longitudinal framework, the conceptual BECCS evolutionary track was determined using SciMAT to elucidate the structure and dynamic aspects of the associated scientific research. The co-word network and thematic evolutionary analysis revealed five main BECCS related themes. While this study provides a systematic study of BECCS research and development, further research should continue to focus on techno-economic analyses and the ecological and environmental impacts (land-use, water, diversity, and bioenergy crops) of BECCS. An increased research focus on the emerging biochar and hydrogen production themes is expected. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A metal catalyst and a hydrogen gas-free approach has been developed for selective reduction of aldehyde to an alkyl group of different substituted furan compounds. In this process, hydrazine hydrate under basic conditions at reflux temperature selectively participated in the reduction of the aldehyde moiety to the corresponding alkyl group of highly reactive furan compounds in a selective manner. The developed protocol was applied for selective and scalable reduction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) up to 250 g to 5-methylfurfuryl alcohol (MFA) in a 70% yield. Under the same process, furfuraldehyde was also tested in a 250 g reaction for 2-methylfuran (MF) synthesis in a highly selective manner and the product was distilled out from a single-pot reaction with gas chromatography (GC) purity ≥90%. The scope of the process was further extended for different substituted furfuraldehydes successfully. In addition, the protocol is found to be efficient for scalable production and easy separation of the product. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Herein, we describe a three-step synthesis strategy starting with a chemical kinetics-governed one-pot two-step reaction. A series of biomass-derived molecules have been converted into ring-structured alkanes suitable for use as transportation fuels or jet fuels with high overall isolated yields of 68-90%. Various biomass-derived molecules can be used as starting materials, which include molecules with different functional groups such as carbonyl groups, benzene and furan rings, olefins, and so forth. Efficient and green reactions, including one-pot two-step reactions and solvent-free reactions, with common reagents and catalysts under mild reaction conditions or even under room temperature, were developed to produce bi(cyclopentane)-based biofuels with diversified and selective structures in good to excellent yields. The obtained products exhibit high densities of 0.87-0.94 g/cm3 and high net volumetric heating values of 38.3-41.4 MJ/L. Besides, they also have other fuel properties comparable to some well-known commercial synthetic fuels such as JET A, JET A-1, JET B, JP-10, and RJ-4. Some of the obtained biofuels have low freezing points of -58 and -80 °C. This general synthetic approach could be extended to a range of precursors with different carbon numbers, which allows the selective generation of high-energy content ring-structured alkanes with carbon numbers of C11-C26. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Pyrolysis of furfural residue (FR) was performed at 450–850 °C by employing a fluidized bed pyrolyzer (FBP). Addition of Kaolin and Ca-bentonite to FR considerably increased the condensate yields. The highest condensate yield (24.96 wt%) was obtained at 650 °C when Ca-bentonite was added. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectrum of pyrolysis oil (PO) indicated that catalysts promoted generation of alkene, amine, sulfate, sulfonyl chloride and oxime during pyrolysis. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS) demonstrated that catalysts significantly increased the content of furfural and phenol in PO and the maximum phenol content (15.36%) was achieved in PO650-3 for CaO. The quite low relative proportion (RP) of ammonia nitrogen in liquid indicated that the dominant form of nitrogen in liquid was not ammonia nitrogen. CaO had the ability to reduce H2S release, indicating significant sulfur retention capacity. The maximum RP (99.29%) of chlorine in bio-char (BC) was observed with the addition of CaO, showing its strong chlorine retention capacity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates the morphology and nanostructure of soot particles during cold-start and hot-start engine operation of a diesel engine using oxygenated fuels. The soot samples were analysed using transmission electron microscopy. The oxygen content in the fuel was varied between 0 and 12%. The results showed that the primary particles during cold-start have significantly smaller size when compared to hot-start engine operation. The addition of oxygenated fuels also resulted in smaller sized primary particles. Smaller radius of gyration and higher fractal dimension of soot aggregates during cold-start would mean smaller aggregate size with a more compact structure. Shorter fringes with a higher inter-fringe spacing for cold-start would mean lower graphitisation of soot particles that could be related to higher oxidation reactivity of soot particles. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The performances of two novel aerogel based catalysts on the production of renewable diesel were compared with an impregnated catalyst for the deoxygenation of undiluted soybean oil. The catalysts were extensively characterized. The aerogel catalysts exhibited a remarkably higher production of hydrocarbons with a reaction rate over 4 times that of the impregnated catalyst and selectivity to uncracked hydrocarbon in excess of 90%. All catalysts exhibited zero order behavior in the undiluted condition tested and no deactivation was detected. The specific acidity appears to be directly linked to the degree of cracking achieved by the catalyst, with the impregnated catalyst being both the most acid and exhibiting the higher degree of cracking, thus lowering its selectivity. The subcritically dried aerogel catalyst had the best overall performance, exhibiting low levels of cracking and high selectivity to larger hydrocarbons, which has been linked to smaller crystallites and higher specific area. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a type of widely recognized environmentally friendly and sustainable biofuel. The key point for the industrial manufacturing of biodiesel is its cost, especially the price of raw oil feedstocks. Oil feedstocks of low quality require highly effective catalysts with more active sites (e.g., acid, base, acid-base, and enzyme) for (trans)esterification. Metal-organic framework (MOF) is a kind of polyporous material that can control its pore size and topological structure to fit the requirements of the catalytic reactions or conversion routes. This review focuses on the application of MOF-based catalysts in the preparation of biodiesel. Two methods of linking the active sites with MOF are introduced including intermolecular forces and chemical bridging or bonding. Four kinds of MOF-based nanocatalysts (i.e., enzyme, base, acid, and bifunctional catalysts) are evaluated and compared with other heterogeneous catalysts. Besides, technologies such as ultrasound and microwave for MOF-based nanocatalyst applications to produce biodiesel through transesterification and esterification are described. Finally, a brief conclusion and perspective for MOF-based nanocatalyst that applies to biodiesel production are provided. The MOF-based functional catalytic materials show great potential in biodiesel production and other relevant biorefineries. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Energy and economic data on gaseous biofuel production in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) can guide their installation, operation mode and modelling. Hydrogen and methane production from waste mainly depends on the cell voltage and biomass content in a bioelectrochemical system. In the present study, the energy efficiency and economic benefits of the simultaneous dual production of gaseous biofuels in a two-chamber MEC fed with digester effluents were established. Combinations of biomass content (5-75%) from dilution of the digester effluents and cell voltage (0.30-1.20 V) were tested for the simultaneous production of biogas in the anodic compartment and hydrogen in the cathodic compartment. The biogas volume reached 33 mL (2.5 mL d−1) within 13 days and the hydrogen gas volume reached 3.5 mL (0.43 mL d−1) within 8 days each in their corresponding compartment (135 mL). The highest energy efficiency based on hydrogen produced relative to the electrical input was 854%, which was obtained at 0.3 V and 40% biomass, while the highest methane production rate was 14.4 mL L−1d−1with a methane purity of 87% and was obtained at 0.43 V and 65% biomass. The highest economic gain was obtained through the production of biogas with a surplus of 20% due to the simultaneous production of hydrogen, reaching 0.010 USD per kg of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removed.

AB  - The present study aimed to determine the effect of co-pyrolysis of sawdust biomass and scrap tyre waste employing different blending ratios of sawdust to waste tyre such as 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100. The thermochemical characterization of feedstocks was carried out by employing the proximate, ultimate analysis, and thermogravimetric (TGA) analyses, calorific values, and scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (SEM-EDX) to select the blending ratio having better bioenergy potential amongst the studied ratios. The blending ratio of 25:75 (sawdust to waste tyre) was selected for the co-pyrolysis study in a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor system based on its solid biofuels properties such as heating value (30.18 MJ/kg), and carbon (71.81 wt%) and volatile matter (63.82 wt%) contents. The pyrolysis temperatures were varied as 500, 600 and 700 ℃ while the other parameters such as heating rate and nitrogen flowrate were maintained at 30 ℃/min and 0.5 L/min respectively. The bio-oil yields as 31.9, 47.1 and 61.2 wt%, bio-char yields as 34.5, 34.2 and 31.4 wt% and gaseous product yields as 33.6, 18.60 and 7.3 wt% at the pyrolysis temperatures of 500, 600 and 700 ℃ respectively were obtained. The blends of sawdust and waste tyres showed the improved energy characteristics which could provide the solution for the beneficial management of sawdust and scrape tyre wastes via co-pyrolysis processing. © 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

AB  - The greatest lever for advancing climate adaptation and mitigation is the defossilization of energy systems. A key opportunity to replace fossil fuels across sectors is the use of renewable hydrogen. In this context, the main political and social push is currently on climate neutral hydrogen (H2 ) production through electrolysis using renewable electricity. Another climate neutral possibility that has recently gained importance is biohydrogen production from biogenic residual and waste materials. This paper introduces for the first time a novel concept for the production of hydrogen with net negative emissions. The derived concept combines biohydrogen production using biotechnological or thermochemical processes with carbon dioxide (CO2 ) capture and storage. Various process combinations referred to this basic approach are defined as HyBECCS (Hydrogen Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) and described in this paper. The technical principles and resulting advantages of the novel concept are systematically derived and compared with other Negative Emission Technologies (NET). These include the high concentration and purity of the CO2 to be captured compared to Direct Air Carbon Capture (DAC) and Post-combustion Carbon Capture (PCC) as well as the emission-free use of hydrogen resulting in a higher possible CO2 capture rate compared to hydrocarbon-based biofuels generated with Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technologies. Further, the role of carbon-negative hydrogen in future energy systems is analyzed, taking into account key societal and technological drivers against the background of climate adaptation and mitigation. For this purpose, taking the example of the Federal Republic of Germany, the ecological impacts are estimated, and an economic assessment is made. For the production and use of carbon-negative hydrogen, a saving potential of 8.49–17.06 MtCO2, eq/a is estimated for the year 2030 in Germany. The production costs for carbon-negative hydrogen would have to be below 4.30 € per kg in a worst-case scenario and below 10.44 € in a best-case scenario in order to be competitive in Germany, taking into account hydrogen market forecasts. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Phytoremediation is an attractive strategy for cleaning soils polluted with a wide spectrum of organic and inorganic toxic compounds. Among these pollutants, heavy metals have attracted global attention due to their negative effects on human health and terrestrial ecosystems. As a result of this, numerous studies have been carried out to elucidate the mechanisms involved in removal processes. These studies have employed many plant species that might be used for phytoremediation and the obtention of end bioproducts such as biofuels and biogas useful in combustion and heating. Phytotechnologies represent an attractive segment that is increasingly gaining attention worldwide due to their versatility, economic profitability, and environmental cobenefits such as erosion control and soil quality and functionality improvement. In this review, the process of valorizing biomass from phytoremediation is described; in addition, relevant experiments where polluted biomass is used as feedstock or bioenergy is produced via thermo- and biochemical conversion are analyzed. Besides, pretreatments of biomass to increase yields and treatments to control the transfer of metals to the environment are also mentioned. Finally, aspects related to the feasibility, benefits, risks, and gaps of converting toxic-metal-polluted biomass are discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Biomass can be envisaged as a potential solution to mitigate the problems that the extensive exploitation of fossil sources causes on the environment. Transforming biomass into addedvalue products with better calorific properties is highly desired. Thermochemical liquefaction can convert biomass into a bio-oil. The work herein presented concerns the study of direct liquefaction of Eucalyptus globulus sawdust. The main goal was to optimise the operating conditions of the process to achieve high bio-oil conversion rates. Studies were carried out to understand the impact of the process factors, such as the residence time, catalyst concentration, temperature, and the biomassto- solvent ratio. The E. globulus sawdust conversion into bio-oil was achieved with a maximum conversion of 96.2%. A higher conversion was reached when the eucalyptus sawdust’s thermochemical liquefaction was conducted over 180 minutes in the presence of a >2.44% catalyst concentration at 160 °C. A lower biomass-to-solvent ratio favours the process leading to a higher conversion of biomass into bio-oil. The afforded bio-oil presented a better higher heating value than that of E. globulus sawdust. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - To upgrade biomass-derived alcohol mixtures to biofuels under solvent-free conditions, MgO–Al2O3 mixed metal oxides (MMO) decorated with Ni nanoparticles (Ni–MgO–Al2O3) are synthesized and characterized. Based on the result, Ni nanoparticles are highly dispersed on the surface of MgAl MMO. As the Ni loading content varies from 2 to 10 wt.%, there is a slight increase in the mean Ni particle size from 6.7 to 8.5 nm. The effects of Ni loading amount, reducing temperature, and Mg/Al ratio on the conversion and product distribution are investigated. With the increase in both the Ni loading amount and reducing temperature, dehydrogenation (the first step of the entire reaction network) is accelerated. This results in an increase in the conversion process and a higher selectivity for the dialkylated compounds. Due to the higher strength and density of basic sites under high Mg/Al ratios, double alkylation is preferred and more long-chain hydrocarbons are obtained. A conversion of 89.2% coupled with a total yield of 79.9% for C5–C15 compounds is acquired by the as-prepared catalyst (prepared with Ni loading of 6 wt.%, reducing temperature of 700◦C, and Mg/Al molar ratio of 3. After four runs, the conversion drops by 17.1%, and this loss in the catalytic activity can be attributed to the decrease in the surface area of the catalyst and the increase in the Ni mean particle size. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Increasing demands for fuel production have led to the identification of brown macroalgae as an alternative feedstock for biofuel production. However, the conversion of macroalgae to biofuel using yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, requires the production of enzymes capable of hydrolysing macroalgal carbohydrates. In this study, three synthetic laminarinase-encoding genes from Rasamsonia emersonii (Relam1), Trichoderma viride (Tvlam1) and Trichoderma reesei (Trlam1), as well as a native laminarinase-like gene from S. cerevisiae (Sclam1) were cloned and expressed in the laboratory S. cerevisiae Y294 strain. Supernatant containing the Relam1 enzyme displayed the highest extracellular activity at 45 °C (0.2 U/mL), while supernatant from the strain co-expressing the Relam1 and Tvlam1 genes showed the highest extracellular activity at 37 °C (0.09 U/mL). The Relam1 and Tvlam1 laminarinases displayed optimum enzymatic activity at temperatures of 45 °C and 37 °C, respectively, and Relam1 retained more than 89% activity after 96 h at 45 °C. Large-scale fermentation of Ecklonia maxima macroalgae with S. cerevisiae Y294[Re/Tvlam1] in a benchtop bioreactor achieved 43% of the theoretic ethanol yield and 66% carbon conversion from laminarin. The successful expression of laminarinase-encoding genes in S. cerevisiae is an important milestone in exploiting brown macroalgae for bioethanol production via consolidated bioprocessing. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The energy demand worldwide is ever-increasing with a growth of 2.3% registered in 2018. This means that there has also been an increasing demand for fuels. Biomass is an interesting alternative to fossil fuels as it contributes to a decrease of their adverse environmental effects. Nonetheless, biomass combustion may present several problems related to, for example, the initial moisture content and the increase of the emission of fine particles. This work describes the study undertaken regarding acid-catalysed liquefaction of different lignocellulosic biomasses as an alternative to process biomasses with high moisture contents and to decrease the emission of fine particles through the partial removal of the mineral matter of biomass. This process allows the production of a liquid biofuel which is more easily burned than the original biomass; moreover, it is also expected to reduce fly-ash forming species. Thus, olive stone/pits, olive bagasse, grape seeds and rice husk liquefaction was carried out at 160 °C using 2-Ethylhexanol as the solvent and a high biomass to solvent ratio of 1:1. In these conditions, a maximum conversion of 55% of the biomass into bio-oil was obtained for olive stone. On the other hand, 60–70% of the inorganic content of the biomasses was removed in the liquefaction stage. This result is an indication that, together with the production of a liquid biofuel, liquefaction can also be used as a pre-treatment to decrease the emission of fine particles associated to biomass combustion. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Several technologies have been developed with the aim of obtaining fuels from algae. In the present work, the fast pyrolysis of three different types of microalgae (Botryococcus braunii, Spirulina platensis, and Pithophora sp.) is investigated focusing on the quality and yield of the liquid product as a potential biofuel. The characterization of microalgae shows an elevated content of lipids in Botryococcus braunii, higher levels of proteins in Spirulina, and an equal number of proteins and carbohydrates in Pithophora sp. A fixed bed reactor, connected to a vacuum system, and nitrogen as inert gas flow are used in the pyrolysis experiments at 300, 400, 500, and 600 °C. At 500 °C, Botryococcus braunii produces the maximum amount of pyrolytic oil (65% yield) while Spirulina and Pithophora sp. affords the greatest amount at 600 °C, in 45% and 28% yield, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of the Botryococcus braunii-derived oils shows a high content of long-chain derivatives of alcohols, carboxylic acids, and unsaturated hydrocarbons. On the other hand, Spirulina-derived oil consists mostly of nitrogenated compounds while oil from Pithophora sp. is composed of oxygenated and/or nitrogenated products, depending on the reaction temperature. The measured higher heating value (HHV) of Botryococcus braunii-derived oil produced at 500 °C is 45 MJ/kg and this bio-oil could be used as a feedstock for fuel production after chemical upgrading to decrease the oxygen content (6.59 wt%). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to produce an alternative energy of biodiesel using field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) seed oil, a novel Fe3O4/graphene oxide-phenylalanine bisulfate ionic liquid core-shell magnetic catalyst was developed. Ferroferric oxide nanoparticles and graphene oxide (GO) were employed to prepare a magnetic carrier of Fe3O4@GO nanocomposite which applied to immobilize phenylalanine bisulfate ionic liquid (PBIL). The immobilized PBIL was characterized by the means of characterization. The heterogeneous Fe3O4@GO@PBIL catalyst was demonstrated to have a high catalytic efficiency that reached 92.38 % of biodiesel yield under the optimal conditions (methanol/oil molar ratio of 10:1, reaction temperature of 60 °C, reaction time of 4 h, catalyst dosage of 25 wt%, stirring speed of 1500 r/min). After transesterification processes, the catalyst could be easily removed from the reaction mixture with an external magnet and showed little deactivation after multiple recycles. The main properties of biodiesel product were reconcilable with the range of test standards of ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. In summary, the prepared Fe3O4@GO@PBIL catalyst behaved a superiorly catalytic performance, which made the produced biodiesel possess the possibility of application to biofuel as an ideal substitution. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study explores the techno-economic analysis of producing Camelina-derived Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet (HRJ) fuel in Montana using the hydro-deoxygenation (HDO) pathway. The HDO method requires added hydrogen and increases cost. The estimated breakeven price of Camelina-derived HRJ fuel generated from the HDO reaction follows the UOP Honeywell procedure. Oilseed cultivation, lipid extraction, and HRJ fuel production were evaluated to estimate the HRJ fuel breakeven price. In an extraction facility with annual processing capacity of 3000 Mg, the breakeven price of Camelina oil was $0.35 per liter over a 20-year operating period and $0.34 per liter over a 30-year period. For a 20-year operating period, the deterministic breakeven price of HRJ fuel was $0.87 per liter with a commercial hydrogen and $1.01 per liter when the plant generated its own hydrogen supply; a 30-year operating period had $0.02 per liter savings. The sensitivity analysis indicates a breakeven price between $0.87 and $1.44 per liter in a facility with an on-site hydrogen plant, and between $0.75 and $1.26 per liter when purchasing hydrogen. An additional $0.02 per liter of capital investment cost is incurred to produce HRJ fuel instead of renewable diesel. Depending on the fuel product, investors would have a capital cost penalty of $0.13 to $0.15 per liter for producing hydrogen on-site. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Addressing dual crisis of fossil fuels i.e. environmental as well as gradually decreasing reserves, design of a nationwide robust supply chain network based on bio-energy has been presented in this work. The four echelon supply chain caters the target of blending 20% bio fuels with conventional fuel during 2018–2026. The mixed integer linear programming model considers handling of multiple types of feed sources, products, transport options while performing the techno, economic and environmental analysis of the supply chain to optimally determine the operational and design decisions. The uncertainty in demand, import product price and biomass feed supply has been tackled using data driven robust optimization approach developed using fuzzy transcription of discontinuous uncertain parameter space using machine learning based unsupervised learning methods. To handle a ∼50% increase in overall biofuel demand over the nine-year planning horizon, the deterministic model shows a dynamically changing supply chain with a ∼20% increase in the newly added locations; however, the worst case robust optimization results are reported to be 6% leaner than the results obtained for the deterministic model. The sensitivity analysis of biomass availability on net present value indicates the need of 43% and above biomass feed supply to run such bio supply chain sector to survive. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work investigates the thermodynamics and kinetics of the synthesis of 5-HMF-cyclic acetal, a fuel additive, from 5-HMF and 1,3-propanediol using lab synthesized, environmentally benign Brønsted acidic ionic liquid (IL) catalyst. Firstly, a thermodynamic study of the acetalization of 5-HMF with different mono and polyalcohols was carried out to evaluate the thermodynamic properties of critical temperature (Tc), critical volume (Vc), critical pressure (Pc), Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf0), enthalpy of formation (ΔfH0), and heat capacity (Cp) using group contribution methods. Then, kinetics of 5-HMF acetalization with 1,3-propanediol was investigated in a batch autoclave using Brønsted acidic IL catalyst and effect of reaction parameters temperature, molar ratio of reactants and time were investigated on the conversion of 5-HMF into 5-HMF-cyclic acetal product and optimized for high 5-HMF conversion and cyclic acetal yield. A first-order pseudo-homogeneous kinetic model with a squared regression coefficient R2 &gt; 0.99 fitted well with experimental data. The activation energy of the acetalization reaction is estimated to be 83 kJ/mol for the 1st order kinetics. Based on the catalyst activity, a plausible reaction mechanism was proposed for the acetalization reaction of 5-HMF and 1,3-propanediol. Finally, this manuscript reports an efficient method for the production of fuel-additive compound and valuable information for predicting the thermodynamic properties for the pure organic components. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, conventional diesel fuel, pure Jatropha biodiesel, Jatropha-butanol blended fuel, and Jatropha biodiesel with fumigated butanol were tested in a single-cylinder direct-injection four-stroke diesel engine. The engine performance, combustion, and emissions were measured at 3600 rpm and brake power of 4.4 kW. For Jatropha, tests revealed that brake thermal efficiency was reduced by 5% and brake-specific fuel consumption was increased by 17% relative to diesel. An overall reduction in exhaust emissions (oxides of nitrogen, unburned hydrocarbons, and smoke opacity) was observed with the exceptions of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. For Jatropha-butanol blended fuel, the efficiency was increased by 2% relative to Jatropha; however, it was still 3% less than that of diesel. The fuel consumption was increased relative to both Jatropha and diesel. In terms of emissions, oxides of nitrogen and smoke opacity were reduced by 12.3% and 72%, respectively, with increased carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions compared to diesel fuel. For Jatropha with fumigated butanol, the efficiency was increased by 4% relative to Jatropha and decreased by mere 1% when compared to diesel. The fuel consumption showed a reduction of 1.4% when compared to Jatropha. A substantial decrease in opacity (85%), oxides of nitrogen (12.7%), and carbon dioxide (4%) emissions was recorded relative to diesel; however, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons were increased. It was concluded that butanol fumigation successfully improved the properties of Jatropha biodiesel and provided an overall better performance relative to blended fuel and neat Jatropha biodiesel. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Fuel blending generally exhibits better low-temperature flow properties (i.e. low viscosity, low freezing point) than pure component fuel. Here, a fuel bending containing bicyclohexane and (cyclopentylmethyl)cyclohexane was synthesized directly by hydroisomerization of cyclohexylphenol to reduce the freezing point. The selectivity of (cyclopentylmethyl)cyclohexane formed by isomerization is enhanced through inhibiting the quick hydrogenation of intermediates using mixing acid catalyst and metal catalyst. Zeolite with strong Brønsted acid site and big surface area, such as HZSM-5 is better for the isomerization. Catalyzed by mixture of Pd/C and HZSM-5, the obtained fuel blending improves the freezing point from 2.6 °C to−22 °C compared with pure bicyclohexane, meanwhile keep the high density of 0.880 g/mL unchanged. The improved low-temperature property is contributed to the formation of (cyclopentylmethyl)cyclohexane. Moreover, the pathways of isomerization and its competition with hydrodeoxygenation are also investigated. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae, as a potential raw material for biofuel, has several advantages compared to other biomass. One effective way to convert microalgae into biofuel is by thermal cracking or pyrolysis, and using a catalyst or not. So far, studies on the use of microalgae, that are converted into biofuels, is still use highly concentrated catalysts in packed bed reactors, which is not economical. Therefore, the aim of this study is to convert Chlorella sp. into biofuels with conventional pyrolysis without and using an activated carbon catalyst using packed bed reactor with bubble column. The reaction temperature is 400–600 °C, pyrolysis time is 1–4 hours, and the active carbon catalyst concentration is 0–2%. The 200 grams of Chlorella sp. and the catalyst was mixed in a fixed bed reactor under vacuum (−3 mm H20) condition. Next, we set the reaction temperature. When the temperature was reached, the pyrolysis was begun. After certain time was reached, the pyrolysis produced a liquid oil product. Oil products are measured for density and viscosity. The results showed that the conventional pyrolysis succeeded in converting microalgae Chlorella sp. into liquid biofuels. The highest yield of total liquid oil is obtained 50.2 % (heavy fraction yield, 43.75% and light fraction yield, 6.44%) at the highest conditions which was obtained with 1% activated carbon at a temperature and pyrolysis time of 3 hours. Physical properties of liquid biofuel are density of 0.88 kg/m3 and viscosity of 5.79 cSt. This physical properties are within the range of the national biodiesel standard SNI 7182-2012. The packed bed reactor completed with bubble column is the best choice for converting biofuel from microalgae, because it gives different fractions, so that it is easier to process further to the commercial biofuel stage.

AB  - Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate factors influencing the yield of bio-oil from the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process of penicillin fermentation residue (PR). The reaction mechanism of the HTL was also studied. The hydrolysis of organic compounds in PR was enhanced, and the bio–oil yield increased with an increase of temperature. When the temperature rose from 280 °C to 320 °C, the yield of bio-oil decreased due to condensation and pyrolysis. Both the residence time and total solid content had effects on the bio-oil yield. The predicted values from the RSM model was in good agreement with the experimental values. Optimized conditions showed that the predicted value of the highest bio-oil yield was 25.91 wt%. The optimized reaction conditions were as follows: reaction temperature was 300 °C, residence time was 174 min, and total solid content was 18 wt%. The bio-oil was analyzed by GC–MS, and showed that it consisted mainly of hydrocarbons, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, and oxygen-containing compounds. Finally, the formation mechanism of these components and their possible reaction paths are presented and discussed. The results will provide useful guidance for regulating the characteristics of antibiotic residues, and realizing their further utilization as a chemical feedstock. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study lipolytic biocatalysts GD-95RM, GDEst-95 and GDEst-lip were immobilized by encapsulation in calcium alginate beads. All three immobilized biocatalysts demonstrated significantly increased thermal stability at 60–70 °C temperatures and the activity of GD-95RM lipase increased by 50% at 70–80 °C following the immobilization. Moreover, encapsulated GDEst-95 esterase retained higher than 50% lipolytic activity after 3 months of incubation with butanol (25%) and ethanol (50%); GDEst-lip enzyme possessed 50% activity after 2 months of treatment with ethanol (25%) and methanol (25%); and GD-95RM lipase displayed higher that 50% activity after two-week incubation with methanol (50%). All three immobilized enzymes displayed long-term storage capability (>50% activity) at least until 3 months at 4 °C. It was also detected that immobilized GD-95RM and GDEst-lip can perform flow hydrolysis of both avocado oil and p-NP dodecanoate in prototype packed-bed column reactor. The analysis of continuous transesterification of avocado or sunflower oil with ethanol or methanol as substrates confirmed that encapsulated GD-95RM and GDEst-lip enzymes is a useful approach to produce fatty acid alkyl esters. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A new series of acidic, dendrimeric polyamidoamine based polymeric ionic liquids of [PAMAM3256Cn] were synthesized with a second generation polyamidoamine dendrimer, alkyl bromides and 1, 3-propane sultone via a two-step procedure. The structure of functional ionic liquids was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The polyamidoamine -1- dodecyl [PAMAM3256C12] catalyst was used for green fuel production via the transesterification of yellow grease. The influence of reaction variables on the green fuel yield was studied using this catalyst. The catalyst was effective having achieved a 93% green fuel yield from yellow grease after 6 h of reaction at 65 °C, using 306.8 mol (10 mmol) (wt % based on molar concentration of lipids) of [PAMAM3256C12] catalyst, a yellow grease-to-methanol molar ratio of 1:20 with a constant agitation speed 800 rpm. The catalyst was showed excellent stability for yellow grease transesterification over four cycles. Additionally, catalysts showed excellent transesterification activity of Jatropha curcas, Ricinus communis, and Pistacia chinensis oil, with green fuel yields of 90, 91, and 92%, respectively. The properties of green fuel were met the ASTM D6751-02 standards. Results indicate that the [PAMAM3256C12] catalyst system shows promising potential as a viable industrial-scale alternative. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, eucalyptus biomass was processed to produce biocrudeviahydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) process. The effect of process conditions (temperature, alkali catalyst, etc.) was initially investigated. The maximum biocrude yield (35.78%, daf) was achieved under subcritical condition (350 °C-catalyst) and a comparatively lower yield under supercritical conditions. The effect of retention time on the product yield, organic compounds composition, and distribution of inorganic elements was explored. HTL experiments were conducted at different retention times (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min) under optimum condition (350 °C-catalyst) to analyze the process efficiency. For the obtained biocrudes, the results show clear trends of changing the content of different functional groups with a change in retention time. Overall, the majority of inorganics and heavy metal contents were found to migrate to the solid phase, which conformed with the ICP results. It was concluded from this study that catalytic subcritical liquefaction at 15 min retention time is a favorable condition for biofuel production and nutrients recovery. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - Furfural can be mass-produced from lignocellulose biomass and can be a platform chemical for producing valuable chemicals. In this study, we examine Ni/SiO2 catalysts for the conversion of furfural under a hydrogen atmosphere. The reactivity and the product selectivity are governed by the reaction temperature and the Ni particle size. A catalyst pretreatment by including calcination prior to hydrogen reduction leads to Ni/SiO2–CR with large Ni particles (∼ 15 nm) and a high selectivity to furfuryl alcohol (FA) at below 200 °C. The Ni/SiO2-R is hydrogen-pretreated without a prior calcination and it contains small Ni particles (∼ 5 nm) and exhibits relatively high selectivity to furan. The turnover frequency (TOF) of furfural conversion is 239 and 408 h−1, respectively, on Ni/SiO2-CR and Ni/SiO2-R at 175 °C, when the former shows 100% selectivity to FA and the latter exhibits a selectivity of around 38% and 62%, to FA and furan, respectively. Moreover, the furan can be reacted to produce propylene and CO by the Ni catalysts at above 200 °C and Ni/SiO2-R exhibits a higher activity than Ni/SiO2-CR. The results suggest that the furfural hydrotreating reaction over Ni catalysts is structure sensitive and a proper design of catalyst and operating temperature can provide a full furfural utilization, either to FA (a biofuel), or to furan and propylene (as chemical feedstock). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biogas consisting primarily of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) can be upgraded to a transportation fuel referred to as renewable natural gas (RNG) by removing CO2 and other impurities. RNG has energy content comparable to fossil compressed natural gas (CNG) but with lower life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study, a light-duty cargo van was tested with CNG and two RNG blends on a chassis dynamometer in order to compare the toxicity of the resulting exhaust. Tests for reactive oxygen species (ROS), biomarker expressions (CYP1A1, IL8, COX-2), and mutagenicity (Ames) show that RNG exhaust has toxicity that is comparable or lower than CNG exhaust. Statistical analysis reveals associations between toxicity and tailpipe emissions of benzene, dibenzofuran, and dihydroperoxide dimethyl hexane (the last identification is considered tentative/uncertain). Further gas-phase toxicity may be associated with tailpipe emissions of formaldehyde, dimethyl sulfide, propene, and methyl ketene. CNG exhaust contained higher concentrations of these potentially toxic chemical constituents than RNG exhaust in all of the current tests. Photochemical aging of the vehicle exhaust did not alter these trends. These preliminary results suggest that RNG adoption may be a useful strategy to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation fuels without increasing the toxicity of the vehicle exhaust. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The worldwide consumption of fossil hydrocarbons in the road transport sector in 2020 corresponded to roughly half of the overall consumption. However, biofuels have been discreetly contributing to mitigate gaseous emissions and participating in sustainable development, and thus leading to the extending of the commercial utilization of internal combustion engines. In this scenario, the present work aims at exploring the effects of alternative fuels containing a blend of 15% ethanol and 35% biodiesel with a 50% fossil diesel (E15D50B35) or 50% Fischer–Tropsch (F-T) diesel (E15FTD50B35) on the engine combustion, exhaust emissions (CO, HC, and NOx), particulate emissions characteristics as well as the performance of an aftertreatment system of a common rail diesel engine. It was found that one of the blends (E15FTD50B35) showed more than 30% reduction in PM concentration number, more than 25% reduction in mean particle size, and more than 85% reduction in total PM mass with respect to conventional diesel fuel. Additionally, it was found that the E15FTD50B35 blend reduces gaseous emissions of total hydrocarbons (THC) by more than 25% and NO by 3.8%. The oxidation catalyst was effective in carbonaceous emissions reduction, despite the catalyst light-off being slightly delayed in comparison to diesel fuel blends. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Solid acid catalyzed cracking of waste oil‐derived fatty acids is an attractive route to hydrocarbon fuels. HZSM‐5 is an effective acid catalyst for fatty acid cracking; however, its microporous nature is susceptible to rapid deactivation by coking. We report the synthesis and application of hierarchical HZSM‐5 (h‐HZSM‐5) in which silanization of pre‐crystallized zeolite seeds is employed to introduce mesoporosity during the aggregation of growing crystallites. The resulting h‐HZSM‐5 comprises a disordered array of fused 10–20 nm crystallites and mesopores with a mean diameter of 13 nm, which maintain the high surface area and acidity of a conventional HZSM‐5. Mesopores increase the yield of diesel range hydrocarbons obtained from oleic acid deoxygenation from ~20% to 65%, attributed to improved acid site accessibility within the hierarchical network. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a process to add value to the biomass derivatives (i.e., levulinic acid), converting it to bioadditives over solid Sn(II) exchanged Keggin heteropolyacid salts. These solid catalysts are an attractive alternative to the traditional soluble and corrosive Brønsted acid catalysts. Among Sn(II) heteropoly salts, the Sn1.5PW12O40 was the most active and selective catalyst, achieving high conversions (ca. 90 %) and selectivity (90–97 %) for alkyl esters and angelica lactone, the main reaction products. The impacts of the main reaction parameters (i.e., catalyst load, temperature, and the molar ratio of alcohol to acid) were investigated. The use of renewable raw material, and an efficient and recyclable catalyst are the main positive features of this process. The Sn1.5PW12O40 catalyst was easily recovered and reused without loss activity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of insects as feedstock for biodiesel production has sparsely been studied and very little is known of the fuel properties and engine performance of insect biodiesel. In this study, biodiesel was initially produced from an insect feedstock M. nigeriensis, then its physicochemical properties were characterized. The biodiesel was produced via the three-step process of lipid extraction, acid esterification (1 wt% H2SO4) and alkaline transesterification (0.5 wt% NaOH). The optimal reaction time, temperature and methanol-oil molar ratio for the acid-esterification process resulted in a free fatty acid conversion of 96.58%. The volumetric yield, fatty acid methyl esters content and physicochemical properties of M. nigeriensis biodiesel were analyzed using various analytical equipment such as the GC-HRMS, and 1H NMR. Analysis of the production process showed that 86.54 vol% biodiesel was obtained from M. nigeriensis oil. Further analysis showed that the biodiesel contained 96.72% fatty acid methyl esters. The composition of the fatty acid methyl esters was found to be 48% saturated esters and 52% monosaturated esters. The biodiesel density (841 kg m−3), viscosity (2.32 mm2 s−1), flash point (125 °C), pour point (−15 °C), cetane number (51.4), higher heating value (41.8 MJ kg−1) and acid value (0.44 mgKOH.g−1) were in compliance with the ASTM D6751 standards. One of the important results to highlight is the remarkably low viscosity of the biodiesel, which is attributed to the high concentration of monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters. Lower viscosity of fuel helps to improve fuel atomization and combustion efficiency, and hence lower emissions. The absence of polyunsaturated fatty acid esters also indicates that the biodiesel will have good oxidation stability. © 2021

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction is one of the most promising technologies to convert high moisture biomass into biofuels. However, understanding the liquefaction mechanism of different biomass fractions is still a challenge. The liquefaction of both lignin and cellulose is frequently studied, but the high diversity of biomass and processes used to generate these fractions makes the direct comparison difficult. In this work, one studies the liquefaction of lignin which has been generated in the process of lignocellulosic ethanol production employing acidic steam explosion. Results are compared with the liquefaction of commercial cellulose. The results have shown that this kind of lignin could produce higher amounts of bio-oil. Moreover, a model to quantify the contribution of the main kinds of reactions to the liquefaction mechanism was proposed. Dehydration was the main reaction observed for both raw materials, however decarboxylation plays a more relevant role in lignin liquefaction, accounting for near 37% of reactions in liquefaction pathway, whereas for cellulose it represents only 13% of reactions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The hydrotreating of bio-oil under mild conditions using inexpensive bimetallic catalysts advances the production of petroleum-like hydrocarbons from biomass wastes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd
Although liquid products derived from the pyrolysis of biomass are promising for the production of petroleum-like hydrocarbon fuels, the catalytic burden of hydrodeoxygenation must be reduced to achieve feasible upgrading processes. Herein, mild hydrotreating of an acid-rich biomass pyrolysis oil (bio-oil) with an unusually high total acid number (588 mg KOH/g bio-oil) was performed to stabilize the low-quality bio-oil. Ru-added TiO2-supported transition metal catalysts stabilized the bio-oil by reducing its acidity more compared to what could be achieved by Ru-free catalysts; this process also leads to lower loss of organic compounds compared to when using a Ru/TiO2 catalyst. Based on the performance of transition metal catalysts, including Ni, Co, and Cu, supported on TiO2, tungstate-zirconia, or SiO2, supported bimetallic catalysts were prepared by adding Ru to the TiO2-supported metal catalysts. The bimetallic catalysts Ru/Ni/TiO2 and Ru/Co/TiO2 exhibited good decarboxylation activity for the removal of carboxylic acids and a higher yield of organic compounds compared to that provided by Ru, which can be deemed appropriate for feedstocks when hydrodeoxygenation needs to suppress the loss of organic reactants. Using these catalysts, the carboxylic acid concentration was reduced to 319–323 mg KOH/g bio-oil with organic yields of 62–63 wt% at reaction temperatures 150–170 °C lower than the temperature required for direct conversion of carboxylic acids to alcohols or deoxygenates. The improved catalytic hydrotreating activity of Ru-added transition metals can be attributed to the high acid site densities of these catalysts along with their improved hydrogenation activities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic pyrolysis of ulva lactuca (UL) macroalgae was studied over a series of ZrO2 supported metal such as Co, Ni and Co-Ni metal catalysts at temperature range of 300–500 °C. Highest bio-oil yield (47.8 wt%) was found with Co-Ni/ZrO2 (10 wt%) catalyst while non-catalytic yielded 42.5 wt% bio-oil. Moreover with increases the metal amount to 15 wt%, the bio-oil yield slightly increased (49.2 wt%). The bio-oil quality significantly improved with using the catalysts compared to the non-catalytic pyrolysis. Catalytic pyrolysis also revealed that introducing Co-Ni into the ZrO2 could result in higher surface area and which increased active sites. Catalytic bio-oils were consisted of mainly long chain hydrocarbon in the range of C6-C16. Moreover, the catalytic bio-oils were showed the higher ‘high heating value’ (HHV) 38.1 MJ/kg as compare to non-catalytic bio-oils (29.4 MJ/kg). Catalysts have been showed excellent recyclability on bio-oil yield and compounds selectivity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Processes based on homogeneous catalysts are the most widely used for industrial production of fatty acid derivatives, despite catalyst loss in aqueous effluents during the wet-purification stage. In this work, dry-purification of the crude bioproducts; ethyl biodiesel and biolubricants, derived from Indian mustard was conducted using various natural mineral (clay) and organic (plant issue) adsorbents to evaluate operating conditions including temperature, contact time and number of treatment cycles and to define the optimal procedure. Adsorbent characterization was determined by average particle size assessed using laser granulometry, morphology and elemental chemical composition measured by scanning electron spectroscopy with microanalysis using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, chemical structure determination based on Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy and porosity and specific area assessed using carbon dioxide or nitrogen adsorption. The quality of the biofuel and biolubricants, before and after dry-purification on the above adsorbents, was evaluated using different methods including Karl Fischer titration, gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy. Montmorillonite clay and finely ground Indian mustard stems (particle size of 100–710 μm) without further pyrolysis or carbonization treatment were found to be the best adsorbents. Combined with the selected dry-purification procedure (35–45 °C, 20 min, single treatment cycle), most impurities including residual glycerides, free glycerin, water, catalysts and metals were removed from the resultant ethyl biodiesel thus meeting the basic biofuel specifications of acid value, color, density, viscosity, flash point, pour point, cloud point, cold filter plugging point, higher heating value, and oxidation stability. Further purification of biolubricants was required using bubble-washing with citric acid and vacuum distillation to obtain a product with acceptable density, viscosity and color. This work highlights the potential of a biorefinery system focused on Indian mustard contributing to a green circular economy, that would benefit both farmers and consumers in the respect of environment; farmers would gain in energy security and flexibility by biofuel, biolubricant and other bioproducts on-farm production, while ensuring healthy food security and offering job opportunities, the whole with reduced chemical and energy inputs and minimized waste effluents. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work aims to convert black liquor- derived softwood lignin into industrially vital aromatic compounds by catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), without the use of external solvent. Lignin melts serve as the solvent itself under HDO conditions. Activated carbon supported NiMoS2 catalysts are prepared by a water/oil micro–emulsion method and the required support acidity is tailored by addition of ZrO2 (10–50%) to the support. The maximum deoxygenation of 82.2% is observed along with a monomer yield of 69.1% in 3 h reaction time, when 10% ZrO2 is added to the carbon support. The yield of monomers is distributed in the following order: alkyl phenolics (23.1%) &gt; guaiacolics (18.1%) &gt; aromatic hydrocarbons (17.5%) &gt; alkanes (10.5%). Interestingly, aromatic hydrocarbons yield increases with increase in time. The catalyst is found to be stable, without any significant loss in the activity and product selectivity when tested for up to five reaction cycles. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Corn ethanol plants generate high-purity carbon dioxide (CO2) while producing ethanol. If that CO2 could be converted into ethanol by carbon capture and utilization technologies it would be possible to increase ethanol production more than 37% without additional corn grain inputs. Gas fermentation processes use microbes to convert carbon-containing gases into ethanol and so have the potential to be used with the CO2 from biorefineries for this purpose. However, as CO2 utilization technologies for converting thermodynamically stable CO2 are typically energy intensive, it is necessary to evaluate the related life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon intensities or CIs) to see whether there are actual emission reduction benefits. In this study, we evaluate the CIs of ethanol produced from high-purity CO2 in corn ethanol plants by gas fermentation plus electrochemical reduction. Our analysis shows that the sources of electricity and hydrogen are key drivers of CO2-based ethanol's GHG emissions. With wind electricity, the design cases show the potential of near-zero CI ethanol (1.1 g CO2e/MJ), but that can increase to up to 331–531 g CO2e/MJ when today's U.S. Midwest electricity mix is used. To avoid the renewable electricity intermittency issue, we considered a power purchase agreement option using wind electricity 40% of the time and using the regional mix for the rest, which provides a 42% GHG emission reduction from the CI of gasoline. © 2020 The Authors and UChicago Argonne, LLC, Operator of Argonne National Laboratory.

AB  - Biogas slurry retention is a critical problem that cannot be solved by using the reuse method. Therefore, a new approach was taken to compensate for the shortcomings in the reuse method. In this study, after ammonia stripping, the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the stripped biogas slurry (SBS) still cannot reach the effluent standard (80 mg/L), so a variety of processes were needed to treat the SBS. Polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and rice husk biochar (B) were used to pretreat SBS. The effect of different pre-treatments on the COD value, ammonia nitrogen concentration, turbidity, total phosphorus (TP), and other indicators was investigated. After different pre-treatments by PAC and biochar, the pretreated SBS was filtered by a ceramic membrane, and the indicators of SBS were removed in the next step. After adding PAC and biochar together, ammonia nitrogen concentration was decreased to 68.09 mg/L, with a removal rate of 63%. The total phosphorus (TP) was also decreased, and its removal rate reached 92.5%. When the SBS was pretreated with PAC and biochar and then filtered through a ceramic membrane under different operating pressures, the removal rates of COD, total nitrogen (TN), turbidity, and suspended solids (SS) reached 81%, 88%, 96%, and 99% respectively. Moreover, by increasing the pressure from 0.1 to 0.3 MPa, the membrane flux was improved from 45 to 100.6 L/m2·h. This study proves that the combined pre-treatments of PAC and biochar can comprehensively remove various indicators from SBS while ensuring membrane flux during the membrane filtration process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was converted into several biofuel additives such as alkoxymethylfurans (AMFs) and 2,5-bis(alkoxymethyl)furans (BAMFs) through two-step sequential hydrogenation and etherification reactions. In the first step, zinc‑iron magnetic nanocatalyst supported on activated carbon (ZnO-Fe3O4/AC) was prepared for the selective hydrogenation of HMF into BHMF and 5-MFA via Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction in three different hydrogen donor alcohols (ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol). The important physical properties of the catalyst such as crystallinity, chemical composition, morphology, reduction behavior, and surface area were studied by using several analytical techniques. The effect of hydrogenation parameters such as catalyst concentration, temperature, and time on the selectivity of (BHMF and 5-MFA), and HMF conversion were studied. The best hydrogenation results were obtained with 0.2 mmole HMF and 100 mg of catalyst at 200 °C for 12 h. In the second step, three commercial Brønsted acid catalysts were used to convert the hydrogenated products into alkoxymethylfurans (AMFs) and 2,5-bis(alkoxymethyl)furans (BAMFs). At the optimum etherification conditions (65 °C and 10 h), a spectrum of mono-, di-, and tri- ether compounds were obtained. The hydrogenation catalyst (ZnO-Fe3O4/AC) was recycled and used for five times without a remarkable reduction in its catalytic activity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Herein we demonstrated an economically beneficial process coproducing biojet fuel and high-value polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from Schizochytrium sp. ABC101 microalgae. Schizochytrium is a promising biofuel source for its rapid growth, high cell density, and fast lipid accumulation via heterotrophic cultivation. The most important feature of Schizochytrium is that half of its lipids are composed of omega-3 PUFAs (i.e., docosahexaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid), which are currently commercialized as dietary supplements at a high price. We observed direct injection of PUFA-rich lipid into a high-temperature catalytic reactor can cause rapid catalyst deactivation via coke deposition. Therefore, the PUFAs were separated by short-path distillation after transesterification. The remaining esters of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were catalytically deoxygenated into C13–C18 n-paraffins, and then subsequently hydrocracked to produce iso-rich paraffins that are suitable as biojet fuel. As the result, 54.6 wt% PUFA-enriched esters (purity: 87.7%) and 20.4 wt% of qualified biojet fuel with respect to the initial lipids were obtained. © 2020

AB  - In this paper, an anionic functionalized ionic liquid antioxidant [MI][C6H2(OH)3COO] was designed and synthesized by a two-step method. The structure was characterized by 1H NMR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The mechanism and antioxidant properties of the ionic liquid antioxidants were studied, and the effect on the catalytic oxidation characteristics of iron and copper ions in biodiesel. The results show that [MI][C6H2(OH)3COO] can significantly improve the oxidation stability of biodiesel and has a significant inhibitory effect on the catalytic oxidation characteristics of iron ions in biodiesel. DFT calculations show that the BDE of O–H in three phenolic hydroxyl groups in [MI][C6H2(OH)3COO] is 300–325 kJ/mol, and that of O–H in [MI][C6H2(OH)3COO]-Fe3+ chelate is 306 kJ/mol. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work describes acetol as fuel for electrochemical oxidation in direct alkaline liquid fuel cells, in addition to electrochemical studies for acetol oxidation reactions (AOR) in alkaline medium, catalyzed by nanostructured palladium electrocatalysts supported on carbon (Pd/C). The AOR's were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry and the results were similar those described in the literature for oxidation of small organic molecules, revealing evident oxidation peaks and chronoamperometric currents. Experiments were performed in an alkaline direct liquid fuel cell (ADLFC), using acetol as fuel and electrocatalysts of the Pd/C type as anode. The results in ADLFC showed high values of open circuit potential (OCP), obtaining 1341.3 mV, considerably higher than the results reported in the literature for ethanol oxidation, in addition to a promising power density, in the maximum result of 31.55 mW cm−2, presenting acetol as a high-performance molecule for oxidation in the ADLFC. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work demonstrates the co-digestion of Used Disposable Nappies (DN) hydrolysate and Expired Food Products (EFP) at 60/40 (v/v) ratio in a two-stage pilot-scale mesophilic (37 °C) anaerobic system, in comparison with previously published data obtained from lab-scale experiments. The aim of the study was to validate the scale-up simulation of the lab experimentation and to evaluate the efficiency of the pilot-scale system. The operational conditions (acidogenic reactor: constant pH 5.5, HRT 2 d, and methanogenic reactor: HRT 20 d) were selected with respect to lab-scale results. The pilot-system succeeded a 75% COD removal, 0.63 ± 0.06 LCH4/LReactor.d and 0.37 ± 0.09 LH2/LReactor.d. The daily obtained gaseous biofuels’ yields correspond to 45.7 MJ of energy, which is 2.85 times higher than the energy needed for the operation of the equipment. It is estimated that the pilot-stage system converted 73% of the chemical energy of the feed materials to gaseous biofuels. Negligible differences between the two scales of the system were recorded, and the results are promising for the development of a full-scale process that would valorize these specific waste streams. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, we present a techno-economic analysis for integrating an electrochemical reactor into a lignocellulosic biorefinery for the purpose of converting biorefinery lignin to higher-value industrial chemicals with co-generation of hydrogen. We consider how the electrochemical reactor impacts the manufacturing costs for producing biofuel and determine a break-even value for the lignin oxidation product stream, which is the minimum lignin conversion product stream value that renders the cost to produce biofuel the same as in the typical biorefinery concept. We conclude that at low extents of lignin conversion, the break-even product stream value is likely too high for the process to be feasible. However, at higher extents of lignin conversion, the break-even product stream value may be between $1.00 and $2.00/kg, depending on capital cost and other manufacturing costs like depreciation. Potential markets for the biomass conversion products include resin manufacturing, where the products would compete with petroleum-derived resin precursors. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose is regarded as the most efficient route to producing fermentable sugars, one kind of promising future biofuel, while physiochemical pretreatment is the initial but most critical step for the efficient utilization of lignocellulose. RESULTS: In this study, a recoverable carbonaceous solid acid catalyst Fe3O4@C-SO3H was used in combined organosolv pretreatment of Eucalyptus biomass at 140–180 °C with 50 vol% ethanol. The introduction of solid acid in ethanol pretreatment remarkably alleviated the requirement of smaller biomass size, but provided less influence on cellulosic degradation, which benefited the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis to glucose. After the pretreatment using 50 vol% ethanol and 20% catalyst at 160 °C, 60.3% hemicellulose and 52.6% lignin were removed from Eucalyptus (75–250 μm) within 60 min, which resulted in a cellulose retention ratio of &gt;90% and improved hydrolysis efficiency by nearly 20 and 2 folds, respectively, compared to untreated and ethanol pretreated materials. CONCLUSION: This study explored a novel pretreatment technique to improve the efficiency of enzymatic saccharification. It also demonstrated that the hydrolysis yield of cellulose had significantly positive correlation with the removal of lignin and hemicellulose in Eucalyptus, but was less affected by cellulose crystallinity. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Currently, the catalytic transformation and utilization of biomass-derived compounds are of great importance to the alleviation of environmental problems and sustainable development. Among them, furfural alcohol derived from biomass resources has been found to be one of the most prospective biomass platforms for high-value chemicals and biofuels. Herein, high-surface-area ZrO2 with abundant oxygen defects and surface acid-base sites was synthesized and used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural into furfural alcohol using alcohol as a hydrogen donor. The as-synthesized ZrO2 exhibited excellent catalytic performance with 98.2% FA conversion and 97.1% FOL selectivity, even comparable with that of a homogeneous Lewis acid catalyst. A series of characterization studies and experimental results revealed that acid sites on the surface of ZrO2 could adsorb and activate the CO bond in furfural and base sites could facilitate the formation of alkoxide species. The synergistic effect of surface acid-base sites affords a harmonious environment for the reaction, which is crucial for catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural with high efficiency. Furthermore, the as-prepared ZrO2 catalyst also exhibited a potential application for the efficient catalytic transfer hydrogenation of a series of biomass-derived carbonyl compounds.

AB  - Nowadays, the use of edible oils with elevate purity in the biodiesel production represents around 70% of the chain of feedstocks applied in the process by the main producing countries at world level. This occurs due, mainly, to reaction limitations of the traditional alkaline route employed industrially. Bypassing drawbacks of the chemical process, enzymatic technique is an effective alternative for the biodiesel synthesis. In this sense, this paper reports results to semi-continuous production of biodiesel on pilot scale, from waste cooking oil, via hydroesterification mediated by different commercial lipases in liquid formulation: Eversa® Transform and its novel thermostable successor Eversa® Transform 2.0. Data for yields, residual acidity, productivities, biocatalysts performance, kinetics and economic analysis are presented in this comprehensive research. Using the best reaction conditions found (40 °C, 0.7 wt% of Eversa® Transform 2.0, 4.0 wt% of water, methanol to oil molar ratio of 6.3:1 and 8 h at a two-step reaction system), 96.2% of FAME yield was achieved. A pseudo-first order model presented a good fit of the experimental data, where a kApp of 0.373∙h−1 was obtained for the process with the best performance. Moreover, for this process, an economic analysis indicated the feasibility of the system through a positive net return and operating cost of US$ 0.50 kg−1 of biofuel. This information served as foundation to conclude that enzymatic hydroesterification catalyzed by liquid lipases has the necessary tools to be implemented on industrial biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) carried out at high temperatures and high hydrogen pressures is one of the alternative methods of upgrading pyrolytic oils from biomass, leading to high quality biofuels. To save energy, it is important to carry out catalytic processes under the mildest possible experimental conditions. The aim of our research was the synthesis of ordered mesoporous SBA-16 type silica materials modified with transition metal atoms (Ir, Ru, Pd, Pt), their physicochemical characterization and use as catalysts in hydrodeoxygenation of model chemicals (guaiacol, syringol, creosol). The HDO process was carried out under mild experimental conditions at temperatures in the range from 90 to 130 °C and hydrogen pressures in the range from 25 to 60 bar. The catalytic tests revealed differences in the catalytic properties of the samples studied. The catalytic systems used assured highly efficient transformations of the examined molecules as well as high selectivity towards chemical compounds with lower O/C ratio and higher H/C ratio as compared to those in the initial substrates. High activity of the catalysts containing precious metals in the experimental conditions applied suggests their potential to improve bio-oil production for biofuels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - This research assessed the economic feasibility of recovering polyol from rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF) waste, collected from dismantled, discarded refrigerators, by a single-phase glycolysis recycling process using domestic crude glycerol (a byproduct of biodiesel production) as a transesterification agent. The study, conducted in Thailand, took into account benefits from the added value of the recovered product, the investment and related operating costs of the process, demand (the need for the recovered product) and supply (the amount of RPUF waste). The results showed that the production of recovered polyol from RPUF waste is economically feasible, with a net present value of 1,113,018 USD, an internal rate of return (IRR) of 22.9%, and a payback period of 4.4 years. Due to the high IRR, project investment should be attractive to both the government and private sector investors. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the economic resilience of the process to uncertainties in key factors, including the prices of the machinery, recovered polyol, crude glycerol and stannous octoate, and the amount of RPUF waste available. The sensitivity analysis showed that the economic feasibility was most sensitive to the price of the recovered polyol, followed by the amount of RPUF waste and the prices of the machinery, crude glycerol and stannous octoate. Based on these results, technological, operational, financial, and regulatory policy recommendations were also presented. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of antioxidants in biodiesels, especially the synthetic TBHQ, has been an efficient way of maintaining the oxidative stability of biofuel during storage for a longer period. Considering other types of products, the use of several natural antioxidants, such as Eugenol, has been promising to increase oxidation stability and conservation of foods, with few studies on biodiesel conservation. This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant action of Eugenol and TBHQ in commercial biodiesel produced from soybean oil and animal fat blend in order to evaluate the efficiency of these antioxidants. Thus, the samples of pure commercial biodiesel (without antioxidant), enriched with the antioxidant TBHQ and Eugenol were prepared and stored in an oven at constant temperature of 43 °C for 150 days. Periodically, the samples were characterized by ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy and oxidation stability (Rancimat method). They were also chemically characterized concerning the acidity, peroxide and iodine amounts. The results showed higher efficiency of the antioxidant Eugenol in relation to the TBHQ, considering that the oxidation stability was within the standard legislations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the quantitative and qualitative attributes of liquid product and biochar obtained from pyrolysis of woody biomass (rubberwood sawdust (RWS)) and non-woody biomasses (oil palm trunk (OPT) and oil palm fronds (OPF)). The prepared biomass was pyrolyzed at temperatures of 500◦ C, 550◦ C, and 600◦ C by using an agitated bed pyrolysis reactor, and then the yields and characteristics of liquid product and biochar were determined. The results showed that liquid product and biochar yields were in the respective ranges of 35.94–54.40% and 23.46–25.98% (wt.). Pyrolysis of RWS at 550◦ C provided the highest liquid yield. The energy content of the water free liquid product was in the range 12.19–22.32 MJ/kg. The liquid product had a low pH and it mainly contained phenol groups as indicated by GC-MS. The biochars had high carbon contents (75.07–82.02%), while their oxygen contents were low (14.22–22%). The higher heating value (HHV) of biochar was in the range 26.42–29.33 MJ/kg. XRF analysis revealed that inorganic elements had higher contents in biochar than in the original biomass. The slagging and fouling indexes of biochar were also different from those of the biomass. High carbon content of the biochar confirms potential for its use in carbon sequestration. The specific surface of biochar was lower than that of biomass, while the average pore diameter of biochar was larger than for raw biomass as revealed by BET and SEM. These results on liquid product and biochar obtained from RWS, OPT, and OPF demonstrate that they are promising feedstocks for biofuels and other value-added products. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - An improved kinetic model for the deoxygenation of fatty acids was developed and compared with previously developed models. The models were compared using data collected from the deoxygenation of oleic acid using a novel, extensively characterized aerogel-based catalyst and previously published data of the deoxygenation of stearic acid, resulting in an extensive analysis ranging from 275 °C to 400 °C. The novel model was able to predict the behavior of reactants, intermediates and products for all cases analyzed in this paper. Akaike and Bayesian information criterions were applied, concluding that the novel kinetic model was indeed the best model to predict the behavior of both our original data and a previously published dataset. Relevant data regarding reaction rates and selectivity for the novel catalyst was given, showing a clear practical use of the results presented in this paper for the design and optimization of deoxygenation reactors. © 2020

AB  - The development of bio-polyol from vegetable oil and its derivatives is gaining much interest from polyurethane industries and academia. In view of this, the availability of methyl oleate derived from palm oil, which is aimed at biodiesel production, provides an excellent feedstock to produce bio-polyol for polyurethane applications. In this recent study, response surface methodology (RSM) with a combination of central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was used to optimise the reaction parameters in order to obtain a maximised hydroxyl value (OHV). Three reaction parameters were selected, namely the mole ratio of epoxidised methyl oleate (EMO) to glycerol (1:5–1:10), the amount of catalyst loading (0.15–0.55%) and reaction temperature (90–150◦C) on a response variable as the hydroxyl value (OHV). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the quadratic model was significant at 98% confidence level with (p-value &gt; 0.0001) with an insignificant lack of fit and the regression coefficient (R2) was 0.9897. The optimum reaction conditions established by the predicted model were: 1:10 mole ratio of EMO to glycerol, 0.18% of catalyst and 120◦C reaction temperature, giving a hydroxyl value (OHV) of 306.190 mg KOH/g for the experimental value and 301.248 mg KOH/g for the predicted value. This result proves that the RSM model is capable of forecasting the relevant response. FTIR analysis was employed to monitor the changes of functional group for each synthesis and the confirmation of this finding was analysed by NMR analysis. The viscosity and average molecular weight (MW) were 513.48 mPa and 491 Da, respectively. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Humanity is facing some major global threats, namely lack of environmental sustainability, the energy crisis associated with the unsustainable reliance on fossil fuels, and water scarcity, which will be exacerbated with the rapid growth of urban areas. Researchers have drawn their attention to microalgae, photosynthetic microorganisms known for their environmental applications, such as wastewater remediation and lipids accumulation, to produce third-generation biofuels to solve some of these major issues. Considering this dual role, this study evaluated the potential of the microalga Chlorella vulgaris on nutrient removal from a paper industry effluent and bioenergy production. Firstly, experiments were performed to assess the potential of this microalga to: (i) successfully grow in different concentrations of a paper industry effluent (20% to 100%); and (ii) treat the industrial effluent, reducing phosphorus concentrations to values below the accepted legal limits. Then, a techno-economic assessment was performed to study the viability of a C. vulgaris biorefinery targeting the remediation of a paper industry effluent and bioenergy production. The results have shown that C. vulgaris was able to successfully grow and treat the paper industry effluent. Under these conditions, average biomass productivities determined for this microalga ranged between 15.5 ± 0.5 and 26 ± 1 mg dry weight (DW) L−1 d−1, with maximum biomass concentrations reaching values between 337 ± 9 and 495 ± 25 mg DW L−1 d−1. Moreover, final phosphorus concentrations ranged between 0.12 ± 0.01 and 0.5 ± 0.3 mg P L−1, values below the legal limits imposed by the Portuguese Environment Agency on the paper industry. Regarding the proposal of a microalgal biorefinery for the bioremediation of paper industry effluents with bioenergy production, the techno-economic study demonstrated that six of the seven studied scenarios resulted in an economically-viable infrastructure. The highest net present value (15.4 million euros) and lowest discounted payback period (13 years) were determined for Scenario 3, which assumed a photosynthetic efficiency of 3%, a lipids extraction efficiency of 75%, and an anaerobic digestion efficiency of 45%. Therefore, it was possible to conclude that besides being economically viable, the proposed biorefinery presents several environmental benefits: (i) the remediation of an industrial effluent; (ii) CO2 uptake for microalgal growth, which contributes to a reduction in greenhouse gases emissions; (iii) production of clean and renewable energy; (iv) soil regeneration; and (v) promotion of a circular economy. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In Mexico, high quantities of lignocellulosic residues are generated. Such residues can be used to produce either biofuels of other products. In this work, a mathematical model representing the supply chain for the conversion of the lignocellulosic biomass in Mexico into biofuels and high-added value products is presented. The model aims to maximize the profit while satisfying as much as possible of the gasoline demand in the country. Additionally, the effect of the variations on the availability of raw materials and the demand of products over the optimal supply chain is analyzed. According to the results, the highest profit can be obtained if the biomass is used to produce levulinic acid and furfural, satisfying all the demand. If it is desired to satisfy the demand of ethanol or butanol, the profit is reduced. Under the studied conditions, only a fraction of the alcohol demand can be covered. © 2020

AB  - Post-grafting methodologies were used to prepare aryl-organosulfonic acid functionalized silica nanoparticles (SO3H-aryl-SiO2NPs) as highly active heterogeneous acid catalysts for catalytic esterification of free fatty acids (FFA) and levulinic acid (LA), and aldol condensation of furfural with 3-methylfuran, well known renewable feedstocks for biodiesel and fuel additives production. The chemical and structural characterization of the SO3H-aryl-SiO2NPs confirmed the success of the functionalization. Complete conversion for all FFA was observed using SO3H-aryl-SiO2NPs after 2 h of reaction. SiO2NPs_CSPTMS showed to be the most active and stable catalyst with no significant loss of activity in the first 5 cycles. In the LA esterification in the presence of an alcohol, complete conversion and selectivity and high reusability were observed (e.g., 83.2% yield after 10 cycles in the presence of 1-propanol, SiO2NPs10_CSPTMS, at 120 °C and 2h reaction). Finally, aldol condensation of furfural and 3-methylfuran had been performed using SiO2NPs_CSPTMS catalysts with almost 100% yield after 10 min at 65 °C, high stability and reusability for 7 catalytic cycles. In general, the prepared SO3H-aryl-SiO2NPs have demonstrated promising catalytic performance for transformation of biomass-derived feedstocks into biodiesel and fuel additives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of waste cooking oil (WCO) in biofuel production can both reduce food safety problems and promote the development of new energy industry. However, to gain higher payoffs, restaurants usually sell total or partial WCO to illegal peddlers. It is of practical significance to study how to improve the willingness of restaurants submitting WCO to biofuel companies. We construct a tripartite game model in the catering network to investigate the dynamic impacts of the intervention of the government, biofuel companies, and consumers on the willingness of restaurants disposing WCO. The results demonstrate that, optimizing the intensity of government supervision and subsidies to restaurants, increasing the demand and the recycling price of biofuel companies for WCO, and strengthening the social responsibility of consumers can effectively improve the willingness that restaurants deal with WCO legally. It is noteworthy that there is a threshold effect on the government fine for restaurants and the recycling price of biofuel companies for WCO. The outcome of blindly increasing these two factors may be inconsistent with the expectation. In addition, the adjustment of a single factor cannot make restaurants in catering networks submit the total WCO to biofuel companies. Therefore, the government should consider promulgating the combination of multiple policies with the coordination of biofuel companies and consumers, to solve the WCO problem better. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increase in energy demand led to the challenging of alternative fuel development. Biofuels from palm oil through catalytic cracking appear as a promising alternative fuel. In this study, biofuel was produced from palm oil through catalytic cracking using the modified HY zeolite catalysts. The Ni and Co metals were impregnated on the HY catalyst through the wet-impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized using X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Pyridine-probed Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) methods. The biofuels product obtained was analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method to determine its composition. The metal impregnation on the HY catalyst could modify the acid site composition (Lewis and Brønsted acid sites), which had significant roles in the palm oil cracking to biofuels. Ni impregnation on HY zeolite led to the high cracking activity, while the Co impregnation led to the high deoxygenation activity. Interestingly, the co-impregnation of Ni and Co on HY catalyst could increase the catalyst activity in cracking and deoxygenation reactions. The yield of biofuels could be increased from 37.32% to 40.00% by using the modified HY catalyst. Furthermore, the selectivity of gasoline could be achieved up to 11.79%. The Ni and Co metals impregnation on HY zeolite has a promising result on both the cracking and deoxygenation process of palm oil to biofuels due to the role of each metal. This finding is valuable for further catalyst development, especially on bifunctional catalyst development for palm oil conversion to biofuels. © 2020. The Authors.

AB  - In this study, antibiotic residue was converted into bio-oil by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) in subcritical or supercritical ethanol/water system. The bio-oil yield increased firstly as the ethanol/water ratio < 1:1, reaction temperature < 280 °C, residence time < 150 min, and thereafter decreased. However, the bio-oil yield continuously decreased with a plunge at 15% as the solid/liquid ratio increased. The change tendency of O/C, H/C and N/C of bio-oil indicated different reaction mechanism of HTL. The addition of ethanol significantly promoted the esterification reaction, leading to increase of aliphatics content of bio-oil, especially branched long-chain aliphatics. Comprehensively considering the bio-oil yield, production cost, higher heating value (HHV) and chemical composition, the optimal process parameters of HTL were obtained as follows: ethanol/water ratio of 1:1, reaction temperature of 280 °C, residence time of 150 min, and solid/liquid ratio of 15%, under which the bio-oil yield was 33.29 wt%, HHV was 33.47 MJ/kg, and the main compositions of bio-oil were esters (>48%). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work investigates the oxidative stability and corrosivity of residual cooking oil (RCO) methyl biodiesel exposed to metallic coupons (copper and carbon steel) under simulated storage conditions (static immersion for 90 days within closed vessels) and the effect of antioxidants (tert-butylhydroquinone, curcumin, propylgallate, and butyl-hydroxyanisole) on biodiesel and metallic surfaces. The induction period measured during the experiment showed that all antioxidants retarded biodiesel degradation due to their antioxidant properties. Scanning-electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction of the metallic surfaces revealed the presence of oxides due to the corrosion by biodiesel in absence of antioxidants. Nevertheless, the presence of carbonaceous solids over the metallic surfaces was found which evidences the anticorrosive properties of the antioxidants, confirmed by X-Ray spectroscopy that showed increase in the content of carbon and oxygen on the surfaces. Measurements of corrosion rate also confirmed the anticorrosive action of all antioxidants. Hence, this work shows the dual properties of antioxidants acting as free radical scavengers in the RCO biodiesel as well as corrosive inhibitors, with a special performance of propylgallate, probably due to the presence of more hydroxyl groups in its structure that also may facilitate its interaction with the metallic surface. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of biodiesel from acidic non-edible oil and waste lipid feedstocks has the drawback of forming soaps in the conventional transesterification process. A solution is the esterification reaction that uses superacid homogenous catalysts; however, it generates dangerous effluents. To overcome this, heterogeneous acid catalysts such as heteropolyacid supported on activated carbon have been studied for the production of biofuel. Due to its high surface area, the activated carbon allows high dispersion of the active phase. The aim of this work was to study the esterification of oleic acid over 12-tungstophosphoric acid (HPW) supported on activated carbon derived from passion fruit biomass (ACP), prepared by chemical activation using ZnCl2. The composites (HPW/ACP) were prepared containing 10–30 wt% of HPW by following two procedures: aqueous impregnation method and incipient moisture. The results showed that the activated carbon prepared from the residue of the passion fruit seed presented a high surface area (465 m2. g−1) and that the HPW impregnation method on activated carbon was a decisive factor on the catalyst performance. XPS, SEM, NMR and N2 adsorption-desorption results showed that in the catalyst obtained by aqueous impregnation (HPW/ACP) surface area decreased (50 m2 g−1), HPW was highly dispersed in the internal pores of the ACP support and presented superior acidity. The incipient moisture impregnation (HPW/IACP) formed HPW particles on the external surface of the support with little interaction among them, resulting in surface area of 90 m2 g−1. The best result of oleic acid esterification with methanol led to 86.4% conversion with catalyst HPW30/ACP, at 100 °C, after 2 h of reaction. The leaching of HPW active phase after the reaction was low ∼1.0–2.6%. This study showed the importance of the HPW impregnation method on activated carbon to obtain a more stable and more active catalyst for the production of biodiesel. A detailed analysis of the catalyst synthesis from a fruit industry residue demonstrated the possibility of operating in a closed-loop system towards cleaner production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis coupled to either thermal or catalytic cracking of mattress foam waste was performed in a laboratory-scale facility consisting of a fixed-bed reactor joined to a tubular cracking reactor. The results showed a great potential for the production of syngas specially at high cracking temperatures. Particularly, fixing 800 °C in the cracking reactor, a CO and CH4 rich gas with a remarkable amount of H2 was obtained. The addition of catalysts (dolomite, olivine or HiFUEL®) significantly decreased undesirable tar formation, (below 10 wt%), simultaneously increasing the gas yield and keeping CO and CH4 as the main components in the stream, becoming a preferable route that the non-catalytic process. Accordingly, this stream could be used preferably for further applications in energy generation because its heating value ranged between 15.7 MJ/Nm3 and 19.6 MJ/Nm3. In particular, the gas obtained by the use of dolomite could be advantageous for the production of organic compounds such as dimethyl ether (DME) as well as its use an engine or boiler to generate electricity in small facilities. In addition, the solid fraction obtained after de process could be used as a medium quality refused derived fuel (LHV ~ 12 MJ/kg) in order to support the internal energy requirements of the process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Enzymes from hyperthermophilic archaea are potential candidates for industrial use because of their superior pH, thermal, and long-term stability, and are expected to improve the long-term stability of biofuel cells (BFCs). However, the reported multicopper oxidase (MCO) from hyperthermophilic archaea has lower redox potential than MCOs from other organisms, which leads to a decrease in the cell voltage of BFCs. In this study, we attempted to positively shift the redox potential of the MCO from hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum (McoP). Mutations (M470L and M470F) were introduced into the axial ligand of the T1 copper atom of McoP, and the enzymatic chemistry and redox potentials were compared with that of the parent (M470). The redox potentials of M470L and M470F shifted positively by about 0.07 V compared with that of M470. In addition, the catalytic activity of the mutants towards 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) increased 1.2–1.3-fold. The thermal stability of the mutants and the electrocatalytic performance for O2 reduction of M470F was slightly reduced compared with that of M470. This research provides useful enzymes for application as biocathode catalysts for high-voltage BFCs. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The hydroprocessing of palm oil was carried out in a continuous fixed bed reactor to produce biojet fuel using Rh/HZSM-5 catalyst. The effect of operating parameters, including reaction temperature, molar ratio, and solvent on the yield of biojet and biodiesel was evaluated. The catalyst deactivated rapidly in the solvent-free system due to carbon deposition. The application of 30% heptane in the feed maintained the conversion of palm oil above 90% for 8 hr. At 330°C, the liquid fuel product yield was slightly less than that obtained at 300°C since more gaseous product was formed. The H2-to-oil molar ratio of 158°C at 300°C was insufficient to maintain the reaction at high conversion. At 300°C and a H2-to-oil molar ratio of 316, the system was stable for the entire experimental period of 8 hr providing the biojet yield and selectivity of 15.3% and 28.5%, respectively. Although, this system was operated at a relatively low temperature for hydroprocessing, the productivity parameter of 0.60 kg product/Kg cat-hr was considerably higher compared to previous data.

AB  - In the perspective of a cleaner and better world, the research of eco-responsible energy systems is an obligation. Biofuels are from the most interesting ways to reduce air pollution without major changes in nowadays vehicles technology. The paper deals with the transformation of lignocellulosic biomass derivative furfural acetone furfural into Jet and Diesel biofuel. The reaction was carried out upon a one pot process including ring opening, hydrogenation and deoxygenation. It was catalyzed by ruthenium supported on silica-alumina catalysts which were prepared and fully characterized using X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and thermal analysis. Bare silica-alumina oxides were only able to partially or totally hydrogenate aliphatic bonds almost without oxygen removing. Whereas supported ruthenium catalysts with different loadings did lead to the production of liquid hydrocarbons with a Turnover Frequency of 0.84 hour−1 and selectivity up to 80%. A general reaction pathway was proposed including all the reaction products identified by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Abstract: Light olefins (C2–C5) are high-value platform chemicals used to produce plastics, lubricants, coating material, and surfactants, and can be intermediates to produce transportation fuels. In this study we report on the development of a Co-based catalyst for direct conversion of fossil as well as biomass derived syngas into light olefins that enables high conversion and olefin/paraffin (O/P) product ratio, minimal selectivity to CO2 (&lt; 1%) and wax formation (C14+ selectivity &lt; 1%). Over a Co/HZSM-5 bi-functional catalyst 38% CO conversion with C2–C5 olefin selectivity of 48%, and O/P ratio of 4.0 was achieved at 240 °C, 17 bar, and 1.5 L/(g–h). In addition to a gaseous olefin-rich stream a C6–C13 mixed olefin/paraffin liquid byproduct was also produced with 25% selectivity. Both Co loading and the HZSM-5 acidity levels were optimized to maintain the balance between the hydrogenation and the cracking activity to generate high levels of C2–C4 olefins. A suite of catalyst characterization tools were used to correlate the physical and chemical property of the catalyst to the performance of the catalyst towards syngas conversion and C2–C4 olefin selectivity.

AB  - With the production of renewable biofuels, concerns about the end of fossil fuels have been partially eliminated. On the other hand, the utilization of low-cost and waste materials to provide the raw essential substances to manufacture these fuels is of paramount importance. Biodiesel is one of these fuels and the required raw materials for the reaction are oil (triglycerides), alcohol and catalyst. In this work, travertine stone powder (as waste in the manufacture of building materials) was used as a catalyst and waste frying oil as a source of triglyceride for biodiesel production. Using thermogravimetric and X-ray diffraction analysis, optimum temperature for catalyst calcination was selected at 900°C. Furthermore, X-ray fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses were performed. Using the design of experiments Response Surface Methodology, the optimum reaction conditions for biodiesel production yield of 97.74% were: reaction temperature 59.52°C (~60°C), time 3.8 h (228 min), catalyst concentration 1.36 wt.% and the methanol to oil molar ratio of 11:6. After reusing four times, the catalyst efficiency was reduced a little, and the biodiesel yield was 89.84%, indicating high strength and stability of the catalyst. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In microalga culturing, one important topic is finding methods of increasing the productivity of algal biomass grown on a large scale. The cultured microalgal biomass must be inexpensive to produce, but rich in the bioactive substances, for use as raw materials for many different purposes, such as functional foods, drugs, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and biofuels. Here we present results about the effects of ferulic acid extracted from rice bran on the growth, photosynthetic activity, and valuable substance content of the eustigmatophyte Nannochloropsis oculata. The results showed that ferulic acid is a growth promoter that increases N. oculata biomass. Addition of 100 mg L−1 ferulic acid to the culture medium led to an increase in cell density and specific growth rate (μ; day−1) of N. oculata. These values were 2.52 and 2.02 times higher, respectively, than those in the control group (without the addition of ferulic acid). Moreover, photosynthetic parameters, lipid and carbohydrate contents, and intracellular pigment contents (such as chlorophyll a and carotenoids) in the treated algal biomass tended to be higher than those in the control treatment. This study provides an initial scientific basis for the improvement of algal biomass productivity and metabolite production in safe and sustainable ways with naturally derived substances. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Abstract: The optimization of fermentation parameters for higher yield of bacterial enzymes have significant contribution to the industries. The qualitative enzymatic assay of strain HK2 in xyan agar and xylose agar plates showed a zone of clearance which indicated that the strain has potential to produce xylanase and xylose/glucose isomerase (GI) respectively. The strain produced highest xylanase activity of 23.09 ± 0.009 U/ml when grown in beechwood xylan and yeast extract in a ratio of 3:2 (w/w) at 37 °C and pH 7 for 96 h. Similarly, the strain preferred 35 to 40 °C temperature and 8 to 9 pH for efficient GI production. The GI activity was 3.3 folds higher than control when 1.5% xylose and 1:3 (w/w) ratio of peptone and yeast extract were used in the culture medium. SDS-PAGE of crude enzyme revealed that the molecular weight of xylanase and GI were about 55 kDa and 63 kDa respectively. The strain HK2 was identified as the Serratia marcescens by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The strain has an ability to utilize low cost agricultural residue and the whole cell immobilization of strain improved the enzyme production which can further minimize the cost of down streaming processing. Thus, S. marcescens HK2 could be a promising candidate for foods and biofuels industries. Graphic Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - In this study, an efficient catalytic system has been developed for the single step conversion of microcrystalline cellulose into 5-hydroxymethyl furfural and levulinic acid using Brønsted acidic ionic liquid (IL) catalysts which have large conjugated structure. The IL catalysts used in this study comprising of different anions ([CF3SO3]−, [HSO4]−, [CF3COO]−, and [Cl]−) with a common cation 1-butyl sulfonic acid-2-phenylimidazolinium ([2-PhIm-SO3H]+), were synthesized in laboratory and characterized. The MCC conversion was carried out in a biphasic reaction medium and yields of 70 % for 5-HMF and 23 % for LA were achieved at 150 °C and 5 h reaction time. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) was performed to identify the key interactions in the stable configurations of the ion-pairs of ILs. The electronic properties and chemical reactivity of the individual ions and ion-pairs of ILs were investigated by performing natural bond orbital (NBO) and second order perturbation theory analysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study is to analyse the off-design performance of an innovative turbocharged solid oxide fuel cell system, fed by biogas and designed to generate 30 kW during nominal operating conditions. The layout of such a plant combines the high efficiencies of the solid oxide fuel cell with a reduced-cost option for fuel cell pressurization: fuel cells are usually pressurized by a micro gas turbine, but the alternative use of a turbocharger, a mass-produced component widely used in the automotive field, could reduce significantly the capital cost of the system. This kind of layout has been rarely investigated in literature, and a detailed performance analysis of a turbocharged SOFC system would be a valuable source of information for both academia and industry. To perform this analysis, a steady-state model has been created using a modular tool developed in Matlab®-Simulink® that includes off-design models of the system components. The model has been used to compare different control strategies. The most suitable control strategy, based on wastegate and cold bypass valves, was adopted, obtaining compliance with the operative constraints and high system efficiency. Afterward, the system steady-state operation was simulated for various electric power loads and ambient temperatures. The performance analysis focused on the effect of these two variables on the system behaviour and has provided insight on the influence on the most significant system outputs, including global efficiency, temperatures and pressures. A system efficiency increase was observed at part load, with values growing from 50.8% to 57.3%. Higher values of ambient temperature resulted in a more significant pressurization of the fuel cell, affecting positively the system efficiency: from 50.5% at 0 °C to 51.0% at 30 °C. Great attention was paid to the system constraints, to verify that the plant could operate properly in all the considered conditions. The proposed control strategy was tested and proved to be effective at achieving this objective. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A catalytic reaction using syngas (CO/H2) as feedstock for the selective β-methylation of alcohols was developed whereby carbon monoxide acts as a C1 source and hydrogen gas as a reducing agent. The overall transformation occurs through an intricate network of metal-catalyzed and base-mediated reactions. The molecular complex [Mn(CO)2Br[HN(C2H4PiPr2)2]]1comprising earth-abundant manganese acts as the metal component in the catalytic system enabling the generation of formaldehyde from syngas in a synthetically useful reaction. This new syngas conversion opens pathways to install methyl branches at sp3carbon centers utilizing renewable feedstocks and energy for the synthesis of biologically active compounds, fine chemicals, and advanced biofuels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

AB  - To improve catalytic performance of metal active sites in hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking conversion of methyl palmitate into high-quality jet biofuel, Ni-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (Ni-BTC) metal-organic framework loaded on MCM-41(Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41) was prepared to enhance the accessibility of Ni active sites, facilitating hydrodeoxygenation to increase alkane yield with suitable arene content. The distance (0.98 nm) between Ni active sites within Ni-BTC structure, which was much larger than that (0.20 nm) within Ni nanoparticles, enabled methyl palmitate with maximum molecule width of 0.68 nm to go through Ni-BTC crystalline plane and get access to Ni active sites more easily. Ni-BTC nanosheets newly assembled in pore channels of MCM-41 were beneficial to effectively screen chain molecules of alkane products. With the largest BET surface area of 1014.2 m2/g, the Ni-BTC@MCM-41 catalyst with 2.5 wt% nickel (2.5Ni-BTC@MCM-41) reduced the nickel metal consumption by 75% comparing to nickel nanoparticle loading (10Ni@MCM-41), but achieved the best catalytic performances through hydrodeoxygenation on Ni active sites and hydrocracking on -SiOH acid sites. The alkane yield increased from 23.3% to 33.9%, while arene yield reduced from 22.4% to 6.5% in jet biofuel products. This resulted in an overall jet biofuel yield of 53.2% with uniform distribution along carbon numbers. The higher heating value of jet biofuel products thus increased to a peak of 45.90 MJ/kg. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - In this study, the components of Terminalia chebula plant such as leaves and seeds are effectively utilized as a green source for the synthesis of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) and production of biodiesel, respectively. CuO NPs have been synthesized through solution combustion route using T. chebula leaves extract as a reducing-cum-fuel agent. Notably, the synthesized CuO NPs are used as a heterogeneous catalyst in the biodiesel production. The synthesized CuO NPs are characterized using XRD, FTIR, FESEM, BET, Zeta potential, DLS and UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. The obtained results showed the monoclinic crystal structure of CuO with rod-like morphology with diameter of around 100 nm. The CuO NPs were successfully utilized for the biodiesel synthesis using T. chebula oil as feedstock by varying the reaction parameters. The maximum of 97.1% yield of T. chebula methyl ester (TCME) is achieved at 3 wt% catalyst loading with methanol to oil molar ratio of 9:1 for the reaction time of 60 min at the of temperature 60 °C with constant stirring speed of 650 rpm. The CuO NPs showed a good catalytic stability up to four cycles with a slight loss in biodiesel yield. The kinetic study of TCME production fits well to the pseudo-first order reaction and the activation energy (Ea) and frequency factor (A) is found to be 40.74 kJ/mol and 5.7 × 104 min−1 respectively. Further, the TCME is also characterized by 1H NMR and FTIR. The fuel properties of TCME are also determined and found to be in the range of ASTM standards. The green chemistry metrics such as E-factor, atom economy, atom efficiency and solvent and catalyst environmental impact parameter have also been studied. Furthermore, the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of the test samples (diesel, biodiesel test blends such as B10, B20, B30, B40 and B100) on a single cylinder diesel engine have also been studied by varying the load (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The prospective of this work is to synthesize a new nanocomposite that serves as an electrode material for the immobilization of biomolecules. In this work surface-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (f–COOH–SWCNTs), and hydrothermally synthesized surface defected 2D nanoplates wrapped by polpyrrole matrix was developed. The developed nanocomposite was utilized as the anode material for the immobilization of enzymes. Nanocomposite f-SWCNTs@Ppy@NiMoSe2 was characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the electrochemical methods including cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The electrochemically controlled bioanode reached to the open circuit potential (OCV) of 0.35 V and delivered the maximum current density of 9.01 mA cm−2 in 50 mM glucose concentration prepared in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) (pH 7.0) as the testing solution at 100 mVs−1 scan rates. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Green diesel is one of the alternative energy sources, which is found to be a second-generation biofuel. Green diesel has a similar molecular structure to petroleum diesel but has better diesel properties, sustainability, and environmental benignity. In this study, green diesel was synthesized from waste cooking oil via a deoxygenation reaction process and blended with petroleum diesel to assess the rate of greenhouse gas emissions. The fuel properties of the formed G100 (pure green diesel) were investigated, and the performance of G5 and G20 (a mixture of 5 and 20% green diesel in petroleum diesel) was tested for combustion in an oil burner. The overall test showed that the combustion of the blends of green diesel produced lower CO2 and SO2 emissions than that of petroleum diesel as a result of the rich oxygen-free fuel content. The obtained fuel properties of pure green diesel and blended green diesel are in compliance with ASTM D6751, ASTM D240-17, and EN 14214 standards. Based on these findings, it is shown that blended green diesel is a clean fuel for the environment and a promising alternative fuel for internal combustion engines. © 2021 ACS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The conversion of biogenic residues to fuels and chemicals via gasification and synthesis processes is a promising pathway to replace fossil carbon. In this study, the focus is set on sewage sludge gasification for syngas production. Experiments were carried out in a 20 kW fuel input bubbling fluidized bed facility with steam and oxygen as gasification agent. In-situ produced sewage sludge ash was used as bed material. The sensitivity of the key operation parameters gasifier temperature, oxygen ratio, steam to carbon ratio, and the space velocity on the syngas composition (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, Cx Hy, H2 S, COS, NH3, and tars) was determined. The results show that the produced syngas has high H2 and CO concentrations of up to 0.37 m3 m−3 and 0.18 m3 m−3, respectively, and is thus suitable for synthesis of fuels and chemicals. By adjusting the steam to carbon ratio, the syngas’ H2 to CO ratio can be purposely tailored by the water gas shift reaction for various synthesis products, e.g., synthetic natural gas (H2 /CO = 3) or Fischer–Tropsch products (H2 /CO = 2). Also, the composition and yields of fly ash and bed ash are presented. Through the gasification process, the cadmium and mercury contents of the bed ash were drastically reduced. The ash is suitable as secondary raw material for phosphorous or phosphate fertilizer production. Overall, a broad database was generated that can be used for process simulation and process design. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The present study investigates the use of hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) to upgrade agro-waste into solid biofuels and the use of citric acid (CA) as a catalyst capable of enhancing energy properties of hydrochars. HTC of pineapple waste (PA) was carried out at 180, 220, and 250 °C at a fixed 1-h residence time with and without the addition of CA. Contrarily to the current understanding with regard to the use of an acid catalyst during HTC, CA addition shows to appreciably increase hydrochar mass yields with HTC temperature, while increasing their degree of coalification and carbon retention. PA hydrochars produced with the addition of CA exhibit higher heating values (HHV) up to 29.7 MJ/kg dry basis (db), low residual ash (between 0.53 and 0.75 wt% db), and better combustion properties when compared to those of hydrochars obtained without CA addition. We show that the increase in mass yields and energy properties observed for hydrochars is due to CA catalytic effect toward back-polymerization of organics in the liquid phase to form secondary char. Secondary char formation and its role in influencing the hydrochar properties as solid biofuels are demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy, proximate, elemental analysis, and combustion reactivity.

AB  - Corn dry milling provides a mature model for lignocellulose biorefinery process. To copy this technical success, a crucial step is to transform lignocellulose into starch-like carbohydrates (SLC), similar to milled corn grain and in a similar fashion to corn dry milling. The transformation process should be zero wastewater generation and sufficient fermentable sugar conservation; the product should be in solid particle form, free of toxic residues, and high enzymatic hydrolysis yield and fermentability. Here we designed and verified a SLC transformation process by (i) biodegradable oxalic acid-catalyzed pretreatment, and (ii) simultaneous biodegradation of inhibitors and oxalic acid catalyst. The oxalic acid catalyst was effective on disrupting the lignocellulose structure and also biodegradable at low pH value. The biodetoxification fungus Paecilomyces variotii FN89 was capable of degrading the furan/phenolic aldehydes and oxalic acid simultaneously and ultimately, while the fermentable sugars were well preserved. The obtained SLC from wheat straw and corn stover were similar to dry milled corn meal in terms of morphological properties, fermentable sugar contents, enzymatic hydrolysis yield, elemental contents, and free of inhibitors and acid catalyst. The bioconversion of starch-like wheat straw and corn stover produced 78.5 and 75.3 g/L of ethanol (9.9% and 9.5%, v/v) with the yield of 0.47 and 0.45 g ethanol/g cellulose/xylose, respectively, compared with 78.7 g/L (10.0%, v/v) from corn meal and the yield of 0.48 g ethanol/g starch. Mass balances suggest that the ethanol yield, wastewater generation, and elemental recycling of the SLC from lignocellulose were essentially the same as those of corn meal. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is one of the most widespread renewable materials in nature. To produce clean and sustainable bioenergy, functional materials and bio-chemicals from lignocellulose, the development of biorefinery in dustry has become the hot topic in recent years. The effective utilization of lignocellulosic biomass can help to relieve the shortage of earth resources, environmental pollution and to achieve the long-term development. Cellulose is the main component of lignocellulosic biomass and the main resource for biorefinery. As a long-chain polysaccharide, cel lulose is self-assembled in plant cell walls as crystalline nanofibers from the linear /3-( 1,4) linked D-glucose poly mers, which can be hydrolyzed to monomelic glucose and eventually be converted to biofuels via microbial fermenta tion or chemical catalysis. However, the complex supramolecular structures of cellulose including allomorphs, crystal- linity and crystal structure, the aggregation of cellulose micro- and macro-fibrils, as well as their multi-interactions with other components (lignin and hemicelluloses) in plant cell walls have formed stable lignocellulosic biomass re calcitrance, inhibiting the bioconversion of cellulose. As the result, biomass pretreatment is necessary for disrupting the complex architecture, swelling the micro- and macro-fibrils and exposing the cellulosic components to make it more accessible to water and cellulase enzymes. The physical, chemical or biological pretreatment firstly facilitates the removal of biomass matrix surrounding the cellulose chains, followed by the disruption of crystalline cellulose fibrils (including the decrystallization, allomorphic transformation and fibrillary separation) , thus contributing high conver sion performance to glucose. This paper reviewed the supramolecular characterizations of cellulose during the pretreat- ments and the mechanisms for enhancement on the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. Different changes of cellulose crystal structure during various kinds of pretreatment methods were summarized, which provide the overall understand ing of the relationships of biomass pretreatments and cellulose supramolecular structures. Furthermore, the research progress concerning cellulose aggregations and their chemical linkages with lignin and hemicellulose carbohydrates ma-trix were reviewed. The current challenges and major problems of cellulose structure research during the lignocellulosic biomass utilization were summarized in the last part, including the analytical methods, efficiency improvements of pretreatments as well as the fundamental linkages of carbohydrate polymers in cell walls, which may help for deeper understanding of cell wall components network and full utilization of lignocellulose. © 2021 Nanjing Forestry University.

AB  - The carboxyl-functionalized porphyrin entangled with benzimidazolium-based ionic liquid (CFPBIL) was successfully synthesized and characterized by FT-IR, FT-NMR and TGA analysis. The proton level was determined by the Hammett acidity function, and DR spectra have been supported to confirm the band gap of photocatalyst. The present study reveals the metal-free, conventional photocatalytic acetalization of furfural to biofuel components under visible light irradiations using carboxyl-functionalized porphyrin catalyst. The effect of different parameters on the photocatalytic reaction, catalyst loading, ratio of furfural:alcohol, duration and intensity of light were investigated. The model reaction of furfural and ethanol in a home-made photoreactor using a 5-W LED presented that a very high yield of furfural acetal (92%) could be obtained under optimized conditions. Moreover, the eco-friendly method of acetalization reactions with higher alcohols (1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octanol) was carried out at optimized reaction conditions which also afforded good to excellent yield of the target products, demonstrating the potential of CFPBIL as a highly active, stable and recyclable heterogeneous photocatalyst. Moreover, physical properties of biodiesel–diesel blends comprising B10, B20 and B30 were determined and furfural acetals were found as a potential fuel additive.

AB  - Recently, research organizations and researchers have been working on finding and producing clean and alternatives to fuels such as biofuels, and thus using new technologies to reduce harmful emissions such as nanoparticle technology. In this regard the use of heterogeneous catalyst for producing biodiesel is classified as a new promising technology as of its characterization for saving in the production total cost. Heterogeneous transesterification reaction is applied to change the waste cooking oil WCO triglycerides to methyl esters with applying lower concentration of alcohol, while the yielded biodiesel has fitted the ASTM norms. In the current investigation, the maximum biodiesel yield obtained was 95% at optimal reaction conditions of 60 min reaction time, 60 °C reaction temperature, 0.01 mass% TiO2 nano-catalyst, 0.3 mass% NaoH, and 1:10 V/V% oil to methanol percentage. Also, the influence of diesel, biodiesel blend, and Cadmium (II)-Based supramolecular coordination polymer nano-additives, {[Cd (EIN)2(SCN)2]}, SCP 1, on the performance and emissions of DI diesel engine were studied experimentally by varying the engine load at 1400 rpm. While the obtained results show a great reduction in UHC, CO, and NOx emissions with increasing the SCP 1 nanomaterials. However, the CO2 emissions show a unique increase in its value by adding SCP 1 as a nanoparticle. If 70 ppm of SCP 1 is used the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) has reached 31.2% as associated with the tested fuels. Also, temperature of the engine exhaust (EGT) was analyzed for all tested fuels, where a consequent reduction was observed. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Butanol is an important compound used as a building block for producing value-added products and an energy carrier. The main butanol production pathways are conventional acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation and catalytic upgrading of ethanol. On the other hand, the application of biomass as a promising substrate for biofuel production has been widely considered recently. However, few studies have compared different butanol production pathways using biomass as raw material. In light of that, the present work aims (i) to provide a short review of the catalytic ethanol upgrading and (ii) to compare conventional ABE fermentation and catalytic ethanol upgrading processes from the economic and environmental perspectives. Aspen Plus v9.0 was used to simulate both processes. The economic and environmental assessments were carried out considering the Colombian economic context, a gate-to-gate approach, and single impact categories. Considering a processing scale of 1000 ton/d, the conventional ABE fermentation process presented a more favorable technical, economic, and environmental performance for butanol production from biomass. It also offered lower net energy consumption (i.e., 57.9 GJ/ton of butanol) and higher butanol production (i.e., 2.59 ton/h). Nevertheless, the proposed processing scale was insufficient to reach economic feasibility for both processes. To overcome this challenge, the minimum processing scale had to be higher than 1584 ton/d and 1920 ton/d for conventional ABE fermentation and catalytic ethanol upgrading, respectively. Another critical factor in enhancing the economic feasibility of both butanol production pathways was the minimum selling price of butanol. More specifically, prices higher than 1.56 USD/kg and 1.80 USD/kg would be required for conventional ABE fermentation and catalytic ethanol upgrading, respectively. From the environmental impact point of view, the conventional ABE fermentation proc e ss led to a lower potential environmental impact than catalytic ethanol upgrading (0.12 PEI/kg vs. 0.18 PEI/kg, respectively). © 2021 Brteam.

AB  - Biological plants such as algae have a great potential of fixating CO2 from flue gases or atmospheric air and converting it into useful biomass. This is because CO2 is part of their photosynthesis process where the gas is an essential input ingredient. In this study, a closed system was designed for algae cultivation and carbon capture as a means to mitigate carbon emissions and at the same time assimilate biomass. Among species of saltwater microalgae there exist the Chlorella, Spirulina and Nannochloropsis among others. The latter was selected, as it is suitable for carbon capture because of its high carbon dioxide absorption characteristics, as well as its high oil content that is needed for the production of biofuel. To achieve this goal, the response of the algae was altered by generational mutations that were driven by environmental control of CO2 concentrations, pH level, and temperature, in addition to the sufficient supply of nutrients. Two flow rates, 2 L/min and 5 L/min were used for the biomass measurements and carbon dioxide capture analysis, resulting in CO2 removal efficiencies of 91.93%, and 65.43%, respectively. The benefit of the proposed system is twofold, first that it combines active carbon capture, which enhances algae growth. The algae is known to be able to thrive in harsh conditions of high temperature and high water salinity, which reflects favorably on the economy of the cultivation system as it does not require any expensive or energy intensive setups or treatments. This cultivation has a pronounced potential of biomass production that is left for a future study. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Electrochemical hydrogenation is a challenging technoeconomic process for sustainable liquid fuel production from biomass-derived compounds. In general, half-cell hydrogenation is paired with water oxidation to generate the low economic value of O2 at the anode. Herein, a new strategy for the rational design of Ru/reduced graphene oxide (Ru/RGO) nanocomposites through a cost-effective and straightforward microwave irradiation technique is reported for the first time. The Ru nanoparticles with an average size of 3.5 nm are well anchored into the RGO frameworks with attractive nanostructures to enhance the furfural's paired electrohydrogenation (ECH) and electrooxidation (ECO) process to achieve high-grade biofuel. Furfural is used as a reactant with the paired electrolyzer to produce furfuryl alcohol and 2-methylfuran at the cathode side. Simultaneously, 2-furic acid and 5-hydroxyfuroic acid along with plenty of H+ and e- are generated at the anode side. Most impressively, the paired electrolyzer induces an extraordinary ECH and ECO of furfural, with the desired production of 2-methylfuran (yield = 91% and faradic efficiency (FE) of 95%) at XFF = 97%, outperforming the ECH half-cell reaction. The mechanisms of the half-cell reaction and paired cell reaction are discussed. Exquisite control of the reaction parameters, optimized strategies, and the yield of individual products are demonstrated. These results show that the Ru/RuO nanocomposite is a potential candidate for biofuel production in industrial sectors. ©

AB  - Bio-oil is a promising source of chemicals and renewable fuels. As the liquid phase obtained from the pyrolysis of biomass, the composition and amount of bio-oil generated depend not only on the type of the biomass but also on the conditions under which pyrolysis is performed. Most fossil fuels can be replaced by bio-oil-derived products. Thus, bio-oil can be used directly or co-fed along with fossil fuels in boilers, transformed into fuel for car engines by hydrodeoxygenation or even used as a more suitable source for H2 production than biomass. On the other hand, due to its rich composition in compounds resulting from the pyrolysis of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, bio-oil co-acts as a source of various value-added chemicals such as aromatic compounds. This review presents an overview of the potential applications of bio-oils and the pyrolysis conditions under which they are obtained. Then, different extraction methods for value-added chemicals, along with the most recent developments, are discussed and future research directions for bio-oil upgrades are highlighted. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Agricultural wastes especially empty fruit bunch (EFB) are abundantly available to be utilized as a feedstock for biochemical synthesis or biofuel production. The components of the waste include lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose. Cellulose, the polymer of glucose, is the active component for producing bio-based chemicals. However, it is difficult to isolate cellulose since lignin, the most outer layer in the waste is recalcitrant. Therefore, the agricultural wastes need to be pre-treated prior to downstream processing. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ozone pretreatment on lignin degradation and total reducing sugar (TRS) yield. EFB was pre-treated using ozone gas in a ribbon-mixer reactor. The chemical and structural changes of ozonated EFB were analysed. The highest delignification obtained were 95.7 wt.% and TRS yield was enhanced to 84.9% at a moisture content of 40 wt.% with 60 g/m3 ozone concentration within one hour of reaction time. Both NMR and FTIR spectra conferred major peaks inferring higher lignin degradation could be achieved using ozonolysis. Copyright © 2021 by Authors, Published by BCREC Group.

AB  - In this work, different approaches for the direct and indirect electrooxidation of glycerol, a by-product of oleochemistry and biodiesel production, for the synthesis of value-added products and of intermediates for biofuel/electrofuel production, were investigated and compared. For the direct electrooxidation, metallic catalysts were used, whose surfaces were modified by promoters or second catalysts. Bi-modified Pt electrodes (PtxBiy/C) served as model systems for promoter-supported electrocatalysis, whereas IrO2-modified RuO2 electrodes were studied as catalyst combinations, which were compared under acidic conditions with the respective monometallic catalysts (Pt/C, RuO2/Ti, IrO2/Ti). Furthermore, inorganic halide mediators (chloride, bromide, iodide) and organic nitroxyl mediators (4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-oxyl and 4-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-oxyl) were evaluated for indirect electrooxidation. These different approaches were discussed regarding selectivity, conversion, and coulombic efficiency of the electrochemical glycerol oxidation. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - As fossil fuel sources are being decreasing day by day, finding renewable energy resources are necessary. Biodiesel is one of the best alternatives in diesel engines. Eruca sativa Madwort (ESM), a nonedible plant and spice of Brassica carinata family, is one of the Iranian local oil seed plants that can grow in poor and unsuitable lands and has been used as an initial source of biodiesel in this study. Transesterification of ESM’s oil has been done using KOH as catalyst and methanol with protection of molar proportion of oil to alcohol (1:6). Indirect Spray Diesel engine (Lister M8.1) is used according to ECE-49 standard and different proportions of diesel fuel and biodiesel (B0, B5, B10, B20, and B35) are selected to investigate functional parameters and exhaust emission. The results show that with the increase in the percentage of the amount of biofuel in the fuel mixture, the amount of NO, NOx, and soot contamination reduce. Also, the diesel engine has best specific fuel consumption equal to 470 g/kw.h at B20. Other basic engine parameters such as power also remain in optimal condition. Finally, it is shown that ESM has good potential to replace the diesel fuel in diesel engines, without major modification in the design of engine and injection system. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this work, catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction of Spirulina platensis using red mud as a heterogeneous catalyst was studied. Red mud, a waste by-product of the Bayer process and its activated form, were used to study the influence of catalyst on biocrude yield and quality. The experimental study was carried out in a batch reactor with a feedstock slurry loading from 10 to 30 wt.%. A maximum yield of bio-crude about 27.5 wt.%, 35 wt.% and 40.7 wt.% for non-catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction and catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction using red mud and activated red mud, respectively at a temperature of 300 °C, 20% slurry concentration and 30 min was obtained. FT-IR and TGA were used to characterize bio-crude from catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction of spirulina. Further, the biocrude was analysed to identify its component using GC-MS. It was found that nitrogen-containing compounds were not much pronounced in biocrude from catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction. To maximise the biocrude yield, the various process conditions such as temperature (250–350 °C), reaction time (20–60 min), slurry concentration (10–30%) and catalyst-to-biomass ratio (1:2–1: 4) were investigated. When the excess of the catalyst was added, a slight increase in biocrude yield was found. For the temperature above 300 °C, the biocrude yield did not improve much. The algal slurry concentration of above 20% led to a decrease in biocrude yield. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Pyrolysis of Prunus dulcis was performed in the presence off our catalysts (ZnCl2, Fe2O3, Alumina, and ZSM-5) using a fixed bed tubular reactor. The factors affecting the product yield were premeditated. Prunus dulcisshowed a high heating value of 19.72 MJ/Kg which makes it very efficient for biofuel usage. Biochar obtained showed high carbon content and large heating values. Different pyrolytic product yields were obtained with different catalysts. Among all the catalysts, alumina and ZSM-5 showed a maximum yield of liquid product. FT-IR, GC-MS, and elemental analysis were performed to determine the product yield and bio oil compositions. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Acid hydrolysis extensively applies as an economical pre-treatment to obtain monosaccharides from recalcitrant lignocellulosic residues. However, inhibitors are inevitably formed and reduce the downstream biofuel yield. Our bacterial isolate Burkholderia cepacia H-2 was capable of biotransforming 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), a common inhibitor, into valuable 2, 5-furan-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA). This isolate also has potential use for detoxifying other inhibitors derived from lignocellulosic acid hydrolysis. To integrate this strain into further lignocellulosic biofuel production processes, strain B. cepacia H-2 was immobilised to biotransform 5-HMF into FDCA and detoxify various inhibitors. Strain B. cepacia H-2 could biotransform 5-HMF into FDCA in the presence of inhibitors derived from lignocellulosic acid hydrolysis and detoxified formic acid, furfural and levulinic acid. The negative effect of approximately 500 mg L−1 inhibitor on 5-HMF biotransformation was as follows (from strongest to weakest): furfural &gt; acetic acid &gt; phenol &gt; formic acid &gt; levulinic acid. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Researchers are looking for alternative energy sources, and biofuel from algae has a significant contribution as an alternative renewable fuel. This paper aims to evaluate fundamental running parameters (heat release rate, peak pressure, specific fuel consumption, and brake torque) and estimates the factors influencing nitrogen oxides (NOx) formation for algae biofuel-diesel blends (A-diesel). The analyses were done using a thermodynamic model and simulated with Diesel-RK and ANSYS. The numerical results of Diesel-RK and ANSYS were validated with experimental in-cylinder pressure data, and also compared with existing literature where needed. Injection timing, engine speed, and inlet temperature were selected as variables for developing the model. The engine speeds were chosen from 1400 rpm to 2500 rpm, and the injection timings were varied from 30° Before Top Dead Center (BTDC) to 20° After Top Dead Center (ATDC). Three algae biofuel blends such as 5% Algae-oil and 95% diesel (A5), 10% Algae-oil, and 90% diesel (A10), 15% Algae-oil and 85% diesel (A15), and pure diesel were considered as fuels for the analysis. The numerical findings indicate that higher inlet temperature, in-cylinder combustion temperature, and advanced injection timing are the main reasons for higher NOx formation during combustion. Among all the four fuels, algae bio-fuel blends showed lower NOx formations than conventional diesel fuel, and also, the engine performance was satisfactory. These two developed numerical models will also help researchers investigate various fundamental parameters of a diesel engine using blended fuels. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aims of this work were (i) to develop and characterize the cheap and efficient CaO/MgO catalyst with a source of CaO from waste blood clamshell mix with MgO, and (ii) to study the catalyst efficiencies on biofuel production via continuous packed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure without any purge gases. The chemical and physical properties of the catalyst were characterized by many techniques. The results can confirm that the ball-mill technique successfully prepared CaO and MgO catalysts. The specific surface area was increased with the increasing of Mg contents. The surface morphologies of calcined catalysts were obvious in a roughly spherical shape. The results were found that not only the Mg content was a significant effect on product and distilled yields, but also reaction temperature was a significant effect as well. The highest pyrolytic oil, derived from 10 %wt Mg catalyst with reaction temperature at 525 °C, was about 80 %, and it can be distilled almost 100 % following ASTM D86. The pyrolytic oils were purified into three types of biofuel, and then the properties of distilled products were examined. The heating values and kinetic viscosity were on standard values except for acidity. Surprisingly, the acidity was decreased comparing with raw material. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increased environmental pollution due to the organic wastes over the world is one of the most burning issues. These organic wastes lie under the category of biodegradable waste and can be effectively degraded from their complex compound into simple one by the action of microbes or other living organisms. Moreover, lignocellulosic biomass is a major part of the biodegradable waste and belongs to the group of renewable energy source, which can be very effective for bioenergy production. Biomasses are made up of different compounds such as cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin and protein. Apart from these components, based on the structural analysis biomass also consist of bioactive substances such as carotenoids, flavonoids, lignin and antioxidants. This review explores a complete overview of the classification, component and the structure of the biomass. Moreover, it discusses how biomasses can play the key role of substrate in many sectors such as industrial bioenergy production including gaseous and liquid biofuels. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

AB  - In line with global demand for greenhouse gas reduction, the aviation industry has invested in biofuels development. A source feedstock that deserves special mention for this process is microalgae, because of its cultivation of renewable biomass with high yields, low cost, and high CO2 sequestering potential. This research aimed the study of microalgae culture with hard potential for biofuel production and its obtaining through catalytic deoxygenation to renewable source hydrocarbons in C12–C18 range. Thus, the oils of the Scenedesmus acuminatus and Cosmarium sp. species were cultivated and identified. Scenedesmus acuminatus oil is the majority composition of palmitic acid (C16:0) and has a higher production and yield than Cosmarium sp. oil. Scenedesmus acuminatus oil was then submitted to catalytic deoxygenation by the semi-batch reaction using the 5% Pd/C catalyst. The obtained results showed a selectivity of 82.9% and n-alkane yielding of 36.6%, placing the specie as potential biojet fuel precursor. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Non-edible seeds are potential candidates for the production of biofuels and other value added products. The specific objective of this work is to measure the dielectric properties (dielectric constant, loss factor, loss tangent and penetration depth) of karanja seed. The data on dielectric properties of karanja seed will be helpful to understand its microwave absorbing capacity and heating behaviour in the microwave pyrolysis process. In this work, the dielectric properties of karanja seed are determined at ambient temperature and in the frequency range 0.1–3.0 GHz. The loss tangent values of karanja seed obtained at the two recognized commercial frequencies of 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz are compared with those of some biomass available in the literature. Finally, the karanja seed is pyrolyzed in a domestic microwave oven at four different power inputs of 500 W, 600 W, 700 W and 800 W. The microwave pyrolysis characteristics of karanja seed is determined in terms of temperature variation inside the reactor and pyrolysis products yields at different power inputs. The chemical composition and fuel properties of the produced bio-oil are measured. The loss tangent of karanja seed at 2.45 GHz is 1.3, which is higher than lignocellulosic biomass like oil palm fibre (0.08). The results of the dielectric properties of the present work shows that karanja seed has better microwave absorption characteristics compared to lignocellulosic biomass. In the actual pyrolysis process in a domestic microwave oven at different power inputs, the heating rate is found to range between 0.661 and 1.157°C/s which is considerably higher than that achieved using electrical heating (0.16–0.33°C/s). The bio-oil yield increases as the power input is increased from 500 to 700 W. The maximum bio-oil yield of 47% is obtained at 700 W. The GC-MS analysis of bio-oil has shown the presence of larger amounts of hydrocarbons, esters, alcohols, very little amount of aromatics and zero sulphur-containing compounds. The fuel properties of bio-oil show that it is a non-acidic and safer fuel. The calorific value of bio-oil is 40% lower than diesel, and its viscosity is 8.5 times higher than diesel. The results reveal that the karanja seed could be pyrolyzed by microwave heating to produce bio-oil which can be used as fuel for diesel engines by suitably upgrading it by blending with diesel fuel. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Green macroalgae comprise significant amount of structural carbohydrates for their conversion to liquid biofuels. However, it generally relies on species characteristics and the variability in seasonal profile to determine its route for bioprocessing. Hence, this study was conducted to analyze the indigenous marine macroalgal strain (Ulva prolifera) with respect to periodic trend and reducing sugar extraction. Consequently, in our investigation, the monthly variation in sugar profile and bioethanol yield was assessed between the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, of which relatively high reducing sugar and fermentative bioethanol yield of about 0.152 ± 0.009 g/gdw and 6.275 ± 0.161 g/L was obtained for the October-month isolate (MITM10). Thereafter, the biochemical profile of this collected biomass (MITM10) revealed carbohydrate 34.98 ± 3.30%, protein 12.45 ± 0.49%, and lipid 1.93 ± 0.07%, respectively, on dry weight basis. Of these, the total carbohydrate fraction yielded the maximum reducing sugar of 0.156 ± 0.005 g/gdw under optimal conditions (11.07% (w/v) dosage, 0.9 M H2SO4, 121°C for 50 min) for thermal-acid hydrolysis. Furthermore, the elimination of polysaccharides was confirmed using the characterization techniques scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Therefore, the present thermochemical treatment method provides a species-specific novel strategy to breakdown the macroalgal cell wall polysaccharides that enhances sugar extraction for its utilization as an efficient bioenergy resource. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The hydrocracking of used cooking oil into biofuel over mesoporous silica was systematically studied. This research aims to induce the silica pores using NaHCO3 and employ the heteropore silica for the hydrocracking process of used cooking oil into biofuel. The mesoporous silica material was synthesized with various ratios of NaHCO3 and TEOS, and calcined at various temperatures. The highest acidity of mesoporous silica was obtained under the optimized conditions (NaHCO3/TEOS ratio of 1:2 and calcination temperature of 400 °C). The modification of silica led to decreasing the crystallinity, particle size, and percentage of Si and O, while increasing the pore size of the catalyst. The hydrocracking of used cooking oil over mesoporous silica with catalyst/feed ratio of 1:100 under H2 gas rate of 20 mL/min for two hours successfully produced the highest proportion of liquid yield. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Production of food, fodder and plant vegetation declined rapidly around the world due to climate change, increase in saline areas and loss of productive lands. A major challenge of sustainable development goals is increasing crop yield and food security by using non-conventional plants in agriculture. Hence, there is a need to develop halophyte based saline agriculture to meet growing demands to feed the world population. Halophytes are the natural inhabitants of salt contaminated degraded soils in diverse environments and offer a multitude of potential applications for sustaining crop productivity. Salt tolerance in halophytes is associated with the plant eco-physiological adaptation that play important roles in their survival and especially adaptation to adverse conditions. Priority attention is required to exploit saline lands and halophytes for economic purposes that will ultimately reduce energy, fresh water and food crises. High nutritional values, resistance to soil containments and production of industrially important products from halophytes offer solutions to apply biotechnological applications that could play an essential role in the production of food, fodder and medicinal supplements. The reclamation of degraded lands, removal of pollutants and the production of alternative energy sources are other emerging fields of applications of these groups of extremophile plants. To increase economic potential and agro-management systems, revegetation and rehabilitation of halophytes are recommended for landscaping, phytoremediation and effluent purification. This review summarizes the perspective of halophytes existence in saline, arid and semi-arid regions as promising alternative sources for industrial applications. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - What differs biochar from charcoal? The simple answer is that biochar is a carbon-rich product obtained from the thermal decomposition of organic material, at the presence of no or only a bit of oxygen. In principle, the production of biochar is comparable to the production of charcoal, one of the oldest and most established processes developed by mankind. While charcoal is made traditionally from wood, biochar can be based on a wide range of biomass and biomass residues. However, a variety of technologies for the production of biochar has been developed in recent years. The technologies are based on pyrolysis, gasification, or hydrothermal carbonization and are ranging from simple units, like heated steel drums to full automated and controlled processes. Therefore, the obtained products have tremendous differences in its properties and resulting qualities. The quality defines the field of application. To obtain the required quality for each application, the right process must be applied. Consequently, it is not enough only to enrich the carbon content by thermal decomposition of organic material. The production of tailor-made biochar for specific high added–value application is much more complex. In addition, side products like liquid biofuels make business cases stronger. If it is done in the right way, biochar production combined with advanced biofuels can be an economic solution to overcome the problems of climate change. “So for the future of mankind, this black matter might give the light at the end of the tunnel.” © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - First, second, third, and fourth-generation biofuels are continuously evolving as a promising substitute to petrodiesel catalyzed by energy depletion, economic and environmental considerations. Bio-diesel can be synthesized from various biomass sources, which are commonly divided into FAME and renewable biodiesel. FAME biodiesel is generally produced by the transesterification of vegetable oils and fats while renewable diesel is produced by hydro-deoxygenation of vegetable and waste oils and fats. The different generation, processing technologies and standards for FAME and renewable biodiesel are reviewed. Finally, the life cycle analysis and production cost of conventional and renewable biodiesel are described. © P. Vignesh et al., published by IFP Energies nouvelles, 2021.

AB  - This study investigates Marula (Sclerocarya birrea) seed oil (SBSO) as a novel feedstock for biodiesel production through the transesterification process catalysed by heterogeneous bio-alkali derived from banana (Musa acuminata) peels. Response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) tools were used for the modelling and optimization of the process variables. The reaction process parameters considered were methanol/SBSO molar ratio, catalyst loading levels, reaction time and temperature. Central composite design (CCD) was espoused to generate 30 experimental conditions which were deployed in investigating the individual and synergetic effect of the process input variables on Sclerocarya birrea oil methyl ester (SBOME) yield. Appropriate statistical indices were adopted to investigate the predictive aptitude of the two models. Analysis shows that ANN model obtained for the transesterification process has a higher coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9846 and lower absolute average deviation (AAD) of 0.07% compared to RSM model with R2 of 0.9482 and AAD of 0.12%. The process modelling outcome also confirmed ANN performance to be more precise than RSM. At methanol/ SBSO ratio of 6:1, catalyst loading level of 2 wt%, process reaction time of 50 min and temperature of 55°C, the experimental maximum SBOME yield was observed to be 96.45 wt % following the ANN predicted yield of 96.45 wt % and RSM predicted yield of 96.65 wt % respectively. The analysed fuel properties of SBOME was found satisfactory within the biodiesel stipulated standard limit(s). The study establishes that SBSO is a good source for biodiesel production and its biodiesel methyl ester is a potential substitute for petroleum diesel and a bioenergy fuel. © 2021 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - Palm oil mill effluent (POME), wastewater discharged from the palm oil refinery industry, is classified as an environmental pollutant. In this work, a heterogeneous catalytic process for biojet fuel or green kerosene production was investigated. The enzymatic hydrolysis of POME was firstly performed in order to obtain hydrolysed POME (HPOME) rich in free fatty acid (FFA) content. The variations of the water content (30 to 50), temperature (30 to 60◦C) and agitation speed (150 to 250 rpm) were evaluated. The optimal condition for the POME hydrolysis reaction was obtained at a 50% v/v water content, 40◦C and 200 rpm. The highest FFA yield (YFA) of 90% was obtained. Subsequently, FFA in HPOME was converted into hydrocarbon fuels via a hydrocracking reaction catalysed by Pd/Al2O3 at 400◦C, 10 bars H2 for 1 h under a high pressure autoclave reactor (HPAR). The refined-biofuel yield (94%) and the biojet selectivity (57.44%) were achieved. In this study, we are the first group to successfully demonstrate the POME waste valorisation towards renewable biojet fuel production based on biochemical and thermochemical routes. The process can be applied for the sustainable management of POME waste. It promises to be a high value-added product parallel to the alleviation of wastewater environmental issues. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Metal–organic framework MOF-5 was used for the first time as a heterogeneous acid catalyst for the simultaneous esterification/transesterification of two nonedible oils, waste cooking oil and Jatropha curcas oil. Fatty acid methyl ester (biodiesel) production was evaluated using an experimental central composite design. A surface response methodology allowed the determination of optimal reaction conditions in terms of methanol/oil molar ratio (3:1–45:1), reaction time (1–15 h), temperature (118–152 °C) and catalyst amount (0.1–0.9 wt%) with a variation lower than 10% with respect to the experimental yield value. The best oil to biodiesel yield conversions were 90.8% (36:1 M/O molar ratio, 12 h, 145 °C, and 0.75 wt% catalyst amount) for waste cooking oil and 88.3% (36:1 M/O molar ratio, 9.59 h, 145 °C, and 0.75 wt% catalyst amount) for Jatropha curcas oil together with respective 93.3% and 94.8% decreases in the free fatty acid content, respectively. It was also verified that the produced biodiesel meets the ASTM D6751 quality standard for some properties of the biofuel and the cost analysis of biodiesel production has also been provided. © 2021, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - In the current study, a domestic food waste containing more than 50% of carbohydrates was assessed as feedstock to produce second-generation bioethanol. Aiming to the maximum exploitation of the carbohydrate fraction of the waste, its hydrolysis via cellulolytic and amylolytic enzymatic blends was investigated and the saccharification efficiency was assessed in each case. Fermentation experiments were performed using the non-conventional yeast Pichia anomala (Wickerhamomyces anomalus) under both separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) modes to evaluate the conversion efficiencies and ethanol yields for different enzymatic loadings. It was shown that the fermentation efficiency of the yeast was not affected by the fermentation mode and was high for all handlings, reaching 83%, whereas the enzymatic blend containing the highest amount of both cellulolytic and amylolytic enzymes led to almost complete liquefaction of the waste, resulting also in ethanol yields reaching 141.06 ± 6.81 g ethanol/kg waste (0.40 ± 0.03 g ethanol/g consumed carbohydrates). In the sequel, a scale-up fermentation experiment was performed with the highest loading of enzymes in SHF mode, from which the maximum specific growth rate, µmax, and the biomass yield, Yx/s, of the yeast from the hydrolyzed waste were estimated. The ethanol yields that were achieved were similar to those of the respective small scale experiments reaching 138.67 ± 5.69 g ethanol/kg waste (0.40 ± 0.01 g ethanol/g consumed carbohydrates). © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) have been identified as promising bio-platform furans that have a wide range of potential applications as biofuels, bioplastics, and biochem-icals. Furfural and HMF are typically synthesized from the substrates of C5 sugars and C6 sugars, respectively. Furfural can also be produced from C6 sugars, which is technically more challenging owing to the higher energy requirement for carbon–carbon bond cleavage. In this study, the simultaneous production of furfural and HMF from glucose was conducted over different binary catalyst systems of Brønsted acids and Lewis acids using γ-valerolactone (GVL) as the solvent. A promising performance was achieved by a SnSO4-H2 SO4 coupling catalyst, with an optimized furfural yield of 42% and an HMF yield of 34% at 443 K in GVL. In addition, a kinetics study was performed in order to understand the mechanism of the simultaneous formation of furfural and HMF from glucose at different temperatures and GVL/water ratios. The results showed that the ratio of furfural to HMF production rate at different temperatures (433 to 463 K) or GVL/water ratios (90 to 80%) was constant close to 1, suggesting that the production of furfural and HMF might follow similar reaction pathways. Finally, the reaction pathway of glucose conversion to furfural and HMF was proposed based on the experimental and kinetics studies. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In this study, hydrothermal and acid pre-treatments were applied to improve the raw material properties of the bean pod. To evaluate the biomass as a fuel, it is superior to have low moisture content, high volatile matter, and carbon content. As acid concentration changed in acid washing and impregnation, different trends were observed in these contents. The optimum working concentration to meet all these properties was chosen as 1 M acid. In hydrothermal pre-treatment, as the temperature increased with constant reaction time, the moisture content of the biomass decreased while the amount of volatile matter was raised. According to the SEM, FT-IR, TGA, and preliminary and elemental analysis characterization results, the samples with high C and low O content after evaluating in hydrothermal pre-treatment at 190 °C for 20 min and hydrothermal pre-treatment at 150 °C for 20 min, washing with 1 M H3PO4, and impregnating with 1 M H3PO4 were subjected to pyrolysis process. When the tar yields obtained from impregnating with 1 M H3PO4 and washing with 1 M H3PO4 samples were compared, it was seen that the washing process gave a higher (19.56%) tar yield. In the pyrolysis experiments, the highest tar yield (22.18%) was achieved by using the hydrothermal pre-treatment at 190 °C for 20 min sample with a volatile matter content of 71.59%. Total volatile matter yields of pyrolysis were listed as (hydrothermal pre-treatment at 190 °C for 20 min) &gt; (washing with 1 M H3PO4) &gt; (impregnating with 1 M H3PO4) &gt; (hydrothermal pre-treatment at 150 °C for 20 min). As a result, it can be concluded that the processes performed as hydrothermal method or acidic pre-treatment compared to raw biomass have an important role in obtaining the desired product distribution and properties in biofuel production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biocatalytic reduction of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) is considered as a sustainable method and has attracted great attention. In this work, a yeast-like fungus, Aureobasidium subglaciale F134 was discovered as a whole-cell biocatalyst for BHMF synthesis from selective reduction of HMF. Its resting cells exhibited high tolerance and excellent selectivity to HMF in a broad pH range. The catalytic capacity of the cells can be substantially improved by Zn2+ ion. Under the optimized reaction conditions, 180 mM HMF substrate was converted into BHMF with a yield of 82 % and 97 % selectivity in 9 h. In a fed-batch conversion, 430 mM of BHMF product was obtained within 15 h, giving a productivity of 3.7 g/l per hour. In addition, it was found that the cells could also selectively convert furfural to form furfuryl alcohol. Discovery of A. subglaciale F134 cells for BHMF synthesis broadens the biocatalyitc toolbox for sustainable production of bio-based chemicals and biofuels from biomass-derived HMF. In addition, the results provide more information regarding the identification of related enzymes in future work. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - De-inking sludge, an ash-rich recycling paper solid waste, is generated in huge amounts. The catalytic deoxygenation potential of calcium-based de-inking sludge in co-pyrolysis mode with wood and its neat thermal conversion to sustainable biofuels are investigated. Wood, de-inking sludge, and their blends are processed in a thermocatalytic reforming (TCR) system. In the presence of de-inking sludge, the oxygen content in the organic phase decreases and the bio-oil calorific value improves as compared to the neat wood-derived bio-oil. The TCR processing of neat de-inking sludge produces a bio-oil with low oxygen content and higher calorific value. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - The partially purified lipase from Aspergillus oryzae ST11 was immobilized on the surface-modified electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibrous membrane. The effects of time and concentrations of glutaraldehyde and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were studied. The immobilized lipase reached the maximum activity at 180 min with the recovered activity of 44.2% (0.22 U/mg-support) in the absence of BSA. After adding 6 mg/mL BSA and 40 mM glutaraldehyde gave the recovered activity at 86.9% (0.43 U/mg-support). It showed the highest stability at pH 7.5 but the soluble lipase was at pH 7.0. In addition, the immobilized lipase was more stable at pH 4.0 and 9.0. The immobilized lipase preserved 56% activity at 70 °C but the soluble lipase had 34% activity. It conserved 86% activity while the soluble lipase had 18% activity after 13 days of storage at 4 °C. The operating parameters such as biocatalyst concentration, water content, and the molar ratio of methanol and palm oil were optimized for biodiesel production. The highest biodiesel conversion (95%) was obtained with the immobilized lipase 15% (w/w), 40% (w/w) 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.0 and methanol/palm oil (3.5:1.0). This immobilized lipase could be reused with 82.9% conversion after 10 cycles of batch production. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Siberian apricot (Prunus sibirica L.), an excellent woody oil plant unique to Asia, is well known for its ability to produce high-oil seeds for use as a promising feedstock of biodiesel. Based on the investigation of natural Siberian apricot resources in China in the early stage, seeds of Siberian apricot from 74 geographic provenances which can fully reflect the overall information were collected. In this research, seeds oil content, fatty acid composition and biodiesel properties were evaluated, and the key environmental factors that caused the variation of these in different geographic provenance were analyzed. The oil content of Siberian apricot seeds is 45.48%–61.07%, and the average was 50.95% for all provenances. The characteristics of oil can identify and quantify eight fatty acids. The most abundant fatty acids were oleic acid (C18:1; 54.02%–76.54%), followed by linoleic acid (C18:2; 16.78%–38.49%) and erucic acid (C16:0; from 3.27% to 6.12%). Monounsaturated fatty acids are the most abundant in 54.75%–77.03% compared with saturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The biodiesel properties of most provenance seeds meet the standards of the ASTM D6751 and GB/T 20828, and a few meet the standards of the EN14214. Through the clustering of oil content and fatty acid composition and the analysis of biodiesel properties indexes, it is concluded that KSK provenance is the most suitable for biodiesel production. The XBZ, HHE, AES, ZLQ and LD provenances may be preserved as potential biodiesel. RDA and VPA showed that the effects of environmental factors on the oil properties of Siberian apricot were ranked as terrain factor > climate factor > soil factor, among which longitude, latitude and altitude are the main terrain indicators. These evaluations can provide reference for the effective utilization and further development of Siberian apricot as a bioenergy feedstock. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Biofuel cells generate electric energy using an enzyme as a catalyst for an electrode but their stability and low battery output pose problems for practical use. To solve these problems, this study aimed to build a long-lasting and high-output biocathode as a catalyst using a highly stable hyperthermophilic archaeal enzyme, multi-copper oxidase, from Pyrobaculum aerophilum (McoP). To increase output, McoP was oriented and immobilized on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) with a high specific surface area, and the electrode interface was designed to achieve highly efficient electron transfer between the enzyme and electrode. Type 1 copper (T1Cu), an electron-accepting site in the McoP molecule, is located near the C-terminus. Therefore, McoP was prepared by genetically engineering a CNT-binding peptide with the sequence LLADTTHHRPWT, at the C-terminus of McoP (McoP-CBP). We then constructed an electrode using a complex in which McoP-CBP was aligned and immobilized on SWCNT, and then clarified the effect of CBP. The amounts of immobilized enzymes on McoP-SWCNT and (McoP-CBP)-SWCNT complexes were almost equal. CV measurement of the electrode modified with both complexes showed 5.4 times greater current density in the catalytic reaction of the (McoP-CBP)-SWCNT/GC electrode than in the McoP-SWCNT/GC electrode. This is probably because CBP fusion immobilize the enzyme on SWCNTs in an orientational manner, and T1Cu, the oxidation–reduction site in McoP, is close to the electrode, which improves electron transfer efficiency. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - An environmentally acidic ionic liquid was prepared with 1-methyl-imidazole, 1,3-propyl sultone and H2SO4, and successfully loaded B acidic ionic liquid into three zirconium-based MOFs to synthesize the catalyst used to prepare biodiesel from Jatropha oil by impregnation method. The structure of the catalyst was characterized by XRD, SEM, FTIR and BET. Compare the activities of the three catalysts (through PSH/UiO-66, PSH/UiO-66NO2, PSH/UiO-66-NH2) experiments, the catalytic activity of PSH/UiO-66-NO2 was found to be the highest, and the conversion rates of Jatropha oil was 96.69%. The effect of methanol oil mole ratio, catalyst dosage, reaction temperature, and reaction time on the conversion of Jatropha oil to biodiesel was investigated, an orthogonal test determined the optimum reaction conditions of using PSH/UiO-66-NO2 catalyst. The optimal reaction conditions were obtained: reaction temperature was 343 K, catalyst dosage to oil was 4 wt%, methanol to oil ratio was 25:1, reaction time was 4 h, and the average conversion rates of Jatropha oil was 97.57%, the methyl ester rate was over 99.98%. The results showed that the four reaction factors had significant effects on the Jatropha oil conversion rates: reaction time &gt; catalyst dosage &gt; reaction temperature &gt; methanol to oil ratio. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dye decolourizing peroxidase (DyP) is an emerging biocatalyst with enormous bioremediation and biotechnological potentials. This study examined the global trend of research related to DyP through a bibliometric analysis. The search term ‘dye decolourizing peroxidase’ or ‘DyP-type peroxidase’ was used to retrieve published articles between 2007 and 2019 from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. A total of 62 articles were published within the period, with an annual growth rate of 17·6%. The highest research output was observed in 2015, which accounted for about 13% of the total output in 12 years. Germany published the highest number of articles (n = 10, 16·1%) with a total citation of 478. However, the lowest number of published articles among the top 10 countries was observed in India and Korea (n = 2, 3·2%). Research collaboration was low (collaboration index = 4·08). In addition to dye decolourizing peroxidase(s) and DyP-type peroxidase(s) (n = 33, 53·23%), the top authors keywords and research focus included lignin and lignin degradation (n = 10, 16·1 %). More so, peroxidase (n = 59, 95·2%), amino acid sequence (n = 27, 46·8%), lignin (n = 24, 38·7%) and metabolism (n = 23, 37·1%) were highly represented in keywords-plus. The most common conceptual framework from this study include characterization, lignin degradation and environmental proteomics. Apart from the inherent efficient dye-decolourizing properties, this study showed that DyP has emerging biotechnological potentials in lignin degradation and remediation of phenolic environmental pollutants, which at the moment are under explored globally. © 2020 The Society for Applied Microbiology

AB  - Industrial research departments and chemical engineering institutes have begun to adopt additive manufacturing technologies, such as stereolithography for producing special types of reactors for continuous production. Microreactors have been widely used to improve the mass and heat transfer processes between immiscible liquid-liquid phases, but with the disadvantage of requiring sophisticated technology for their manufacture. In this paper, an approach for producing millireactors by stereolithography and rapid optimization of millireactor design with circular cross-section is presented. Transesterification of vegetable oils with alcohols is widely used method for biodiesel synthesis, generally taking place in a batch reactor. Microreactors due to their short residence times and high biodiesel yields are currently being explored for continuous production, but have disadvantages in low production volumes and high pressure drops. To overcome above-mentioned problems, millireactors with channel diameters from 1.5 mm to 3.5 mm were produced in order to investigate the impact of channel dimensions on conversion of sunflower oil to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Transesterification reaction of sunflower oil using methanol with addition of KOH base catalyst to FAME was monitored by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Results show that millireactors with smaller channel dimensions and processes with higher temperatures at certain residence times can be used to achieve better biodiesel yield in much shorter time than batch reactors. In addition, continuous way of FAME production in millireactors is presented. Production in millireactors provided an improvement when compared to microreactors because they have low pressure drops and higher production volumes. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The monitoring of biodiesel production processes is currently performed by methods requiring high reagent consumption and long response times. Aiming to overcome these drawbacks, this article developed chemometric models combining principal component analysis (PCA), multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) and mid infrared spectroscopy to determine simultaneously the concentrations of the main components, methyl esters and triglycerides, along transesterification reactions. This methodology also tried to model the intermediates (fatty acids plus monoglycerides, and diglycerides), thus providing semi-quantitative predictions for these components. These reactions were carried out in different experimental conditions according to a factorial design with two factors, the batch of soybean oil (raw material) and the alcohol:oil molar ratio. The concentration values estimated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as the reference method, were the inputs for the correlation constraint used as a key step in the multivariate calibration MCR-ALS models. The spectral profiles recovered for the methyl esters and for the triglycerides have shown high correlations (greater than 0.985) in comparison to the reference spectra. In addition, the spectra calculated for fatty acids, monoglycerides and diglycerides showed absorption bands characteristic of functional groups present in these molecules, mainly the hydroxyl and carbonyl stretching bands. The root mean square errors of calibration and prediction estimated for the triglycerides and for the methyl esters were within the range from 1.9% to 6.3%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Kitchen waste (KW) has gradually become a prominent problem in municipal solid waste treatment. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising method used to make fuel oil from food and KW. However, the upgrading of bio-oil is particularly important for the sake of industrial reuse. In this study, the KW from university restaurants was subjected to HTL experiments in order to study theoretical feasibility. With the change of conversion temperature and residence time, the optimal conversion working conditions in this study were determined according to the quality and yield of the bio-oil. Moreover, the bio-oil upgrading effects of different additives (hydrogen chloride, sodium hydroxide, and iron(III) chloride) on the HTL of KW were studied. Alkaline additives have an inhibitory effect on the bio-oil yield and positive effect on coke yield. Acidic additives and iron (Fe)-containing additives can promote bio-oil yield. As an important aspect of upgrading, the effect on the nitrogen content of bio-oil with additives was revealed. The alkaline and Fe-containing additives have little effect on reducing the viscosity of the bio-oil while with the appropriate ratio (2.5 mol•kg−1) of acidic additives to the raw material, the static and dynamic fluidity of the oil phase products are reduced to about 0.1 Pa•s. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The feasibility of using intermittent cycle extended aeration system (ICEAS) sludge as a lipid feedstock for biodiesel production was investigated. The main effects of in situ transesterification parameters, reaction temperature (30–70 °C), reaction time (4–24 h), catalyst concentration (1–5% v/v), and proportion of methanol to dry sludge (5–25 ml/g) at five-levels as well as their simultaneous interactions were evaluated to develop an empirical model. Optimized conditions were obtained at 60 °C, 4.65% (v/v) H2SO4, 17.84 h reaction time, and 5:1 methanol to dry sludge proportion (ml/g), leading to a maximum of 18.58% (w/w) biodiesel yield with 94.23% fatty acid methyl ester content. This result was higher in comparison with yields derived from conventional activated sludge, membrane bioreactor and anaerobic-anoxic-oxic processes. The ICEAS technology advantages are owned to its different configurations leading to production of one blended sludge, shorter hydraulic retention time and higher chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen ratios. The predominance of fatty acid methyl esters such as palmitic, oleic, palmitoleic, stearic, linoleic and myristic acid methyl ester, in the obtained biodiesel, indicated suitability of ICEAS sludge as feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2020

AB  - Significant components of cost-effective medium for Magnusiomyces capitatus A4C extracellular lipase (ECL) production were optimized via a five-level factorial design. A simplistic, economical, and green approach was adopted for biomimetic mineralization to prepare multilayered nano-entrapped ECL, which were then applied as biocatalysts for the production of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). The optimal ECL (0.8 mg protein/mL) and CuSO4∙5H2O (1.2 mM) showed the highest capacity for enzyme loading. The ECL-CuSO4-hybrid showed an 89.7% conversion of triacylglycerides into FAME via transesterification and a 98.7% conversion of oleic acid into FAME via esterification at 72 h. The ECL-CuSO4-hybrid gave 65% and 78.7% FAME production after 5 successive reuses via transesterification and esterification reactions, respectively. Therefore, these ECL-inorganic hybrid biocatalysts have high economical potential to be used for the production of biodiesel as the future petrodiesel replacement. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biodiesel, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), is an environmentally friendly alternative fuel produced by transesterification of renewable lipid feedstocks for diesel engines. Methanolysis of waste frying oil (WFO) was catalyzed by Rhizopus stolonifer 1aNRC11 mutant F whole-cell lipase that produced under solid state fermentation (SSF) using wheat bran (WB) and black cumin meal as the main substrate. Cultivation SSF parameters of R. stolonifer mutant were optimized using Plackett-Burman (PB) experimental design and Face-centred Central Composite Design (FCCD), taking FAME yield as a response for whole-cell lipase production ability. PB results showed that cultivation temperature, medium pH and moisture content were the most significant parameters, which were selected for optimization by FCCD. The optimal determined conditions were as follows: WB (10 g), black cumin meal (6%, w/w of WB), fodder yeast (1%, w/w of WB), moisture content (1.5 g water/g solid), inoculum size (3 discs), initial pH (8), and cultivation time (4 day) at 28 °C. With R. stolonifer mutant cultivated in the optimized conditions, the FAME yield reached 82.6% that was close to the predicted yield of 85.7%. The analysis of variance showed that the model was statistically significant (p value of.0001) and could explain 89% of the variability in the response. These results indicated that the optimization conditions increased biodiesel production by about 43% compared to the basal medium (57.60%). The optimization of SSF conditions using low cost components makes the whole-cell lipase production process from the R. stolonifer 1aNRC11 mutant F economically effective for application in biodiesel production from WFO. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The use of microalgae as a raw material to extract pigments and biodiesel is an economical and environmental challenge due to the costs and toxicity of the chemical used, as well as the time and energy consumed in the production chain. Thus, the objective of this work was to develop an environmentally friendly sequential process to obtain lutein and biodiesel from Choricystis minor var. minor microalga. To overcome these challenges, the wet biomass of this microalga was dried in the sun, and lutein was obtained in an optimized extraction using methanolic solution containing potassium hydroxide, followed by the extraction of fatty acids and conversion into biodiesel using methanolic solution with phosphoric acid. The optimum conditions for lutein extraction were 0.3 mL of methanolic solution with 8% potassium hydroxide, at 60 °C for 1 hour. Then, the residual biomass was used to produce biodiesel by acid catalysis, with addition of 0.8 mL of methanolic solution containing 10% phosphoric acid at 100 °C for 1 hour. This approach obtained 1 kg of lutein and 10.83 kg of biodiesel from 75.75 kg of dry biomass of microalga. From the economical point of view, biodiesel is a less valuable coproduct of the lutein production chain. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - To obtain high-quality biofuel, bio-oil obtained from fast pyrolysis of woody biomass was pretreated with ion exchange resin (amberlyst 36) at 50°C, 100°C, and 150°C, and then the recovered liquid product was upgraded using hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) with Pt/C at 300°C. After the two-stage upgrading, 4 types of products (gas, light oil, heavy oil, and char) were obtained. Two-immiscible liquid products were consisted of organic heavy oil, derived from bio-oil, and aqueous light oil, based on the ethanol. The mass balances of the HDO products were influenced by the pretreatment temperature. Ion exchange pretreatment of bio-oil was effective in reducing the char formation during the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process. The pretreatment also improved the following heavy oil properties: the water content, heating value, viscosity, acidity, and oxygen level. As a parameter used to indicate the biofuel acidity, the total acid number (TAN) value, was clearly reduced from 114.5 (bio-oil) to 34.1–78.2 (heavy oils). Furthermore, the water and oxygen contents of bio-oil (21.1 and 52.6 wt%, respectively) declined after the pretreatment followed by HDO (ranged 5.1–6.9 and 19.0–25.5 wt%, respectively), thereby improving its higher heating value (HHV) from 17.2 MJ/kg (bio-oil) to 26.2–28.1 MJ/kg (heavy oils). The degree of deoxygenation (DOD) increased as the pretreatment temperature decreased, and the highest energy efficiency (79.8%) was observed after pretreatment at 100°C. In terms of catalyst deactivation during the reaction, both carbon deposition and surface cracking intensified with increasing pretreatment temperatures. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass enhances the conversion efficiency to produce biofuels and value-added chemicals, which have the potential to replace fossil fuels. Compared to physicochemical and other pretreatment techniques, the hydrothermal methods are considered eco-friendly and cost-effective. This paper reviews the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of steam explosion and subcritical water hydrolysis as the two promising hydrothermal technologies for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. Although the principle of the steam explosion in depolymerizing the lignin and exposing the cellulose fibers for bioconversion to liquid fuels is well known, its underlying mechanism for solid biofuel production is less identified. Therefore, this review provides an insight into different operating conditions of steam explosion and subcritical water hydrolysis for a wide variety of feedstocks. The mechanisms of subcritical water hydrolysis including dehydration, decarboxylation and carbonization of waste biomass are comprehensively described. Finally, the role of microwave heating in the hydrothermal pretreatment of biomass is elucidated. © 2021

AB  - Background: Cumulative reported evidence has indicated that renewable feedstocks are a promising alternative source to fossil platforms for the production of fuels and chemicals. In that regard, the development of new, highly active, selective, and easy to recover and reuse catalysts for biomass conversions is urgently needed. The combination of enzymatic and inorganic heterogeneous catalysis generates an unprecedented platform that combines the advantages of both, the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of enzymes with the ordered structure, high porosity, mechanical, thermal and chemical resistance of mesoporous materials to obtain enzymatic heterogeneous catalysts. Enzymatic mineralization with an organic silicon precursor (biosilicification) is a promising and emerging approach for the generation of solid hybrid biocatalysts with exceptional stability under severe use conditions. Herein, we assessed the putative advantages of the biosilicification technology for developing an improved efficient and stable biocatalyst for sustainable biofuel production. Results: A series of solid enzymatic catalysts denominated LOBE (low ordered biosilicified enzyme) were synthesized from Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase and tetraethyl orthosilicate. The microscopic structure and physicochemical properties characterization revealed that the enzyme formed aggregates that were contained in the heart of silicon-covered micelles, providing active sites with the ability to process different raw materials (commercial sunflower and soybean oils, Jatropha excisa oil, waste frying oil, acid oil from soybean soapstock, and pork fat) to produce first- and second-generation biodiesel. Ester content ranged from 81 to 93% wt depending on the raw material used for biodiesel synthesis. Conclusions: A heterogeneous enzymatic biocatalyst, LOBE4, for efficient biodiesel production was successfully developed in a single-step synthesis reaction using biosilicification technology. LOBE4 showed to be highly efficient in converting refined, non-edible and residual oils (with high water and free fatty acid contents) and ethanol into biodiesel. Thus, LOBE4 emerges as a promising tool to produce second-generation biofuels, with significant implications for establishing a circular economy and reducing the carbon footprint. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The production of chemicals and fuels from renewable biomass with the primary aim of reducing carbon footprints has recently become one of the central points of interest. The use of lignocellulosic biomass for energy production is believed to meet the main criteria of maximizing the available global energy source and minimizing pollutant emissions. However, before usage in bioenergy production, lignocellulosic biomass needs to undergo several processes, among which biomass pretreatment plays an important role in the yield, productivity, and quality of the products. Acid-based pretreatment, one of the existing methods applied for lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment, has several advantages, such as short operating time and high efficiency. A thorough analysis of the characteristics of acid-based biomass pretreatment is presented in this review. The environmental concerns and future challenges involved in using acid pretreatment methods are discussed in detail to achieve clean and sustainable bioenergy production. The application of acid to biomass pretreatment is considered an effective process for biorefineries that aim to optimize the production of desired products while minimizing the by-products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For co-processing of bio-oil and conventional fossil feed in existing refinery fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units, little attention has been paid to the increased aromatics and basic nitrogen content in the feed associated with the introduction of bio-oil and how it affects FCC performance. In this contribution, the effect of blending two bio-oils obtained from different catalytic treatment of wheat-straw pyrolysis vapors with atmospheric residue was tested using a microactivity testing unit (MAT). The catalysts used for the pyrolysis vapor phase upgrading included i) a Na/γ-Al2O3 deoxygenation catalyst, and ii) a Pt/TiO2 catalyst in combination with H2 atmosphere. The oxygen content of both bio-oils was similar at ~ 7–8 wt%, but the Na/γ-Al2O3 bio-oil had a lower total acid number (TAN) of 5 mg KOH/g and a higher basic nitrogen (BN) content of 0.7 wt% compared to the Pt/TiO2 bio-oil (15 mg KOH/g, 0.4 wt% BN). The processing of the upgraded bio-oils in blends with atmospheric residue in MAT increased the yields of dry gas, CO, CO2, and coke at the expense of naphtha (decrease by 2.8 percentage points) and decreased the conversion by ~ 2.5 percentage points. This is attributed to the high aromaticity and basic nitrogen content of the two bio-oils. The lower basic nitrogen content and higher degree of saturation for the Pt/TiO2 bio-oil may explain its slightly higher conversion (by ≤ 1 percentage points) compared to the Na/γ-Al2O3 bio-oil. This contribution provides important information for refinery operators interested in FCC co-processing of fossil oils and biomass-derived pyrolysis oils with elevated content of nitrogen and aromatics. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The biomass ‘waste-to-energy theory transforms low-value biomass within value-added outputs which include high financial potential has drawn awareness from both academicians and enterprise professionals. The biomass waste administration method involves the production, chamber, acquisition, transferal, and conveyor, processing, and distribution of all classes of trash. However, most of these methods are yet under the growing state and attempting to acquire a business partly due to several hurdles, such as proper infrastructure, feedstock, technological conditions, administration management, and communal recognition. Recently, thermochemical methods towards agricultural biomass to power conversion appear encouraging and achievable. The comparative benefit of thermochemical transformation above others is higher potency and adaptability among subsisting infrastructure tools. These advantages differ by method and final product, presenting compliance in matching market necessities. Advantages include environmental change: upon a life-cycle base, high-level biofuels generated through thermochemical transformation could decrease greenhouse gases by around 50% or higher than traditional gasoline. In this article, a comprehensive report on the advancement of the five most encouraging ways of thermochemical transformation (i.e. incineration, pyrolysis, gasification, plasma, and torrefaction), three ways of biochemical renovation (i.e. composting, bioethanol fermentation and anaerobic digestion) and landfill methane capture have been discussed. The modern evolution of several conversion technologies for biomass regeneration has also been examined and benchmarked towards global development. Additionally, the core scientific hurdles in profiting these green pieces of machinery are emphasized. © 2021

AB  - This work investigates H2 production through aqueous phase reforming (APR) of synthetic brewery wastewater in a continuous fixed bed reactor with Pt and PtRe (3 wt %) catalysts supported on activated carbon. The influence of weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) and superficial Ar gas flow velocity (VAr) was assessed for the sake of optimisation, while reaction temperature and pressure were maintained at 225 °C and 28 bar, respectively. H2 production was found to be higher using the PtRe catalyst at the lowest WHSV (0.03 h−1) and highest VAr (0.8 cm s−1). The comparison of the maximum H2 production obtained in this work (27.9 μmol min−1) with other treatment processes shows the potential of the application of APR process for H2 production from brewery wastewater. Despite the different reaction conditions tested, the catalysts showed deactivation with time on stream, which was related to the formation of solid deposits on the surface of the catalysts. Therefore, future research should be related to the development of more stable catalysts, strategies that avoid deactivation by coking and regeneration processes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A glucose oxidation catalyst comprising carbon nanotube, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), gelatin, glutaraldehyde (GA) and glucose oxidase (GOx) (CNT/[TTF-GOx]/Gelatin + GA) is suggested to enhance the reactivity of glucose oxidation reaction (GOR), and the performance and stability of enzymatic biofuel cells (EBCs) using this catalyst. In this catalyst, TTF is used as mediator to transfer electron effectively, while GA is crosslinked to gelatin to form non-soluble network. The structure prevents the dissolution of gelatin from aqueous electrolyte and reduces the leaching-out of GOx and TTF molecules. To confirm the crosslinking effect of GA and gelatin, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and electrochemical evaluations are utilized. According to FT-IR analysis, it was observed that the amide I peak shifted after crosslinking. This is evidence showing the appropriate network formation and the reactivity of CNT/[TTF-GOx]/Gelatin + GA is well preserved even after multiple potential cycling. In addition, its GOx activity is regularly monitored for one month and the measurements prove that the structure prevents the leaching out of GOx molecules. Based on that, EBC using the anodic catalyst shows excellent performances, such as open circuit voltage of 0.75 V and maximum power density of 184 μW/cm2. © 2021 Science Press

AB  - Phycoremediation is an emerging technology, where algae-based processes were used to effectively remove nutrients, organic wastes, and toxic heavy metals from the polluted environment. The waste algal biomass obtained after phycoremediation, which may contain residual hazardous materials, could still be used as feedstock to produce biofuels/bioenergy preferably through thermochemical conversion technology. This review proposes a synergistic approach by utilizing the phycoremediation-derived algal biomass (PCDA) as feedstock for efficient hazardous waste treatment and clean energy generation via supercritical water gasification (SCWG). The review provides an in-depth study of catalytic, non-catalytic, and continuous SCWG of algal biomass, aiming to lay out the foundations for future study. In addition, the concepts of heat integration as well as water, nutrient, and CO2 recycling were introduced for a sustainable algae-to-biofuel process, which significantly enhances the overall energy and material efficiency of SCWG. The production of biofuel from algal biomass via other advanced gasification technologies, such as integration with other thermochemical conversion techniques, co-gasification, chemical looping gasification (CLG), and integrated gasification and combined cycle (IGCC) were also discussed. Furthermore, the discussion of kinetics and thermodynamics models, as well as life cycle and techno-economic assessments, appear to provide insights for future commercial applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this present study, biodiesel was produced from an eco-friendly and non-edible AMC seed oil using a biocatalyst. The optimum biodiesel yield was obtained as 92% by undergoing microwave transesterification with 20 min time, 4.5 wt% catalyst amount and 1:12 oil-methanol ratio at 55 °C. The activation energy needed for the reaction was 51.9 kJ/mol. The thermodynamic parameters for the transesterification process, such as enthalpy and entropy were 56.4 kJ/mol and −0.091 kJ/mol. Further, the engine studies were carried out for different fuel injection pressures and injection timing. Performance results reveal that BSEC and BTE of biodiesel are lower and higher than that of diesel fuel for 400 bar FIP and 27° CA bTDC FIT at full load respectively. However, except NO, composite emissions of CO, UBHC and dry soot are comparatively lesser than that of standard emission norms. It is thereby inferred from the experimental results that the optimum fuel injection pressure and timing are 400 bar and 27° CA bTDC. The developed ANN model precisely predicted the out data with a higher R2 value for biodiesel synthesis and engine characteristics. Hence, it can be concluded that ANN is the best tool for predicting output data. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to severe geopolitical uncertainty, tensions between nations that produces fuel/oil, and trade sanctions, almost no nation can guarantee a consistent fuel supply and that can affect the progress or development of countries significantly as fuel is the backbone of the energy supply. Counties are exploring different alternative energy sources that can be sustainable and locally available. Waste-based biofuel, i.e., biodiesel, can be an excellent cheap alternative to diminish the fuel supply–demand conflict and can also play an important role in mitigating the adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions in the environment. This study focuses on four biodiesel feedstocks that are classified as having the most potential (microalgae oil), being the most prevalent (palm oil), the most popular (soybean oil), and the most proven (coconut oil) identified by the current researchers. The Scopus research database recognises these biodiesel feedstocks. The ranking among these studied biodiesel feedstocks is focused on technical, economic, environmental, and social aspects with eighteen criteria. There are five weighting methods used in this study, namely EQUAL, Criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC), ENTROPY, Analytical hierarchical process (AHP), and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP). Five multiple criteria decision analysis processes, namely PROMETHEE, Weighted sum method (WSM), Weighted product method (WPM), Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and VIse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) are applied for ranking these feedstocks. The results reveal that Coconut oil rated the best followed by Microalgae and Palm oil, whereas Soybean was considered to be the worst performer among those feedstocks. This ranking of biodiesel feedstocks is important for commercialisation purposes as well as providing a clear picture to the researchers, scientists, policymakers, and Government stakeholders. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This present research aims at developing an efficient and reusable base catalyst to improve the biodiesel production for the need of green chemistry and sustainable development. To achieve this, the copolymer, namely poly(allylglycidyl ether-divinylbenzene-glycidyl methacrylate) (poly(AGE-DVB-GMA)), was firstly incorporated in the Fe3O4 nanoparticles forming magnetic Fe3O4-poly(AGE-DVB-GMA) composites, and then organic guanidine was bound on the magnetic matrices via covalent bonds with active epoxy groups. The characterization of the as-made magnetic copolymer support and solid base catalysts was performed by several techniques, and the results revealed that the guanidine base was successfully tethered on the magnetic copolymer support. This developed solid catalyst possessed large surface basicity of 2.45 mmol/g and highly magnetic responsiveness with saturation magnetization value of 18.13 emu/g, displaying good activity to the transesterification of soybean oil to biodiesel in a heterogeneous manner. Under the transesterification conditions of methanol/oil molar ratio of 20:1, catalyst dosage of 7 wt%, reaction temperature of 65 °C, reaction duration of 8 h, the biodiesel yield of 92.6% was attained over the guanidine-based solid catalyst. Moreover, the catalyst could be easily separated under an external magnetic field, and showed satisfactory catalytic activity even after four reuse cycles, thus posing considerable potential for the sustainable and clean production of biodiesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cyclopentanol is a novel biofuel with high resistance to auto-ignition, which can be used as a promising additive to gasoline fuel. It is of great importance to gain a comprehensive understanding on the oxidation chemistry of cyclopentanol. The reaction of cyclopentanol with hydroxyl radical plays an important role in both combustion and atmospheric chemistry. In this study, we calculate the rate constants of cyclopentanol reaction with hydroxyl radical over a wide temperature range of 200–2500 K, using multistructural canonical variational transition state theory. The effects of variational, quantum tunneling and multistructural torsional anharmonicity were analyzed. The results show that the variational and multistructural torsional anharmonicity effects play a key role, while the quantum tunneling effect is nearly negligible for the studied reaction system. Moreover, the rate constants of reactions with submerged forward barrier heights show a non-monotonic behavior, while a positive temperature dependence is found for the rate constants of reactions with positive forward barrier heights. Our calculated total rate constants are in good agreement with those estimated in the literature (Cai et al., CNF, 2019), however, significant discrepancies are observed in the branching ratios of reaction channels. The rate constants reported in this study are expected to be more accurate and will benefit the understanding on the oxidation chemistry of cyclopentanol. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A heterogeneous CaO/Ag nano catalyst was developed and applied for biodiesel production from transesterification of soybean oil. The silver performed synergistic effects with CaO on promoting biodiesel production. The CaO/Ag nano catalysts exhibited abundant strong basic sites with larger BET surface area (7.02 vs 2.05 m2/g), pore diameter (58.84 vs 37.08 nm) and pore volume (0.070 vs 0.016 cm3/g), which significantly reduced mass transfer resistance of triglycerides during transesterification and improved the mass transfer constants. Response surface methodology was applied to investigate the influence reaction parameters and optimize biodiesel yield. A maximized biodiesel yield of 90.95 ± 2.56 % was achieved using methanol:oil molar ratio of 13, CaO/Ag loading of 5%, reaction time of 90 min and reaction temperature of 72℃. The optimized biodiesel yield for CaO catalyzed transesterification was 88.40 ± 3.34 %, using similar reaction conditions but with 180 min of reaction time. Both nano catalysts were consecutively reused for five times. Kinetic and thermodynamic studies of CaO and CaO/Ag catalyzed transesterification were performed and compared. Economic evaluation of biodiesel production using CaO and CaO/Ag was performed and compared to provide insights for heterogeneous catalyst application for biodiesel production on industrial scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Generation of energy is a vital process for sustenance of human life. Quality of human life is undoubtedly linked to the efficient generation and use of energy. The choice of alternative fuels is of the utmost significance due to the decline of fossil fuel reserves and their effect on global warming. One of the most important areas of research all over the world is the generation and distribution of sustainable energy. There are, in fact, many sustainable fuel resources. In this study, we describe the problem of selecting alternate fuel using novel types of hesitant multi criteria decision-making equation methods. The considered fuel systems are Electricity, natural gas, biodiesel, ethanol, and propane. In the selection of alternative fuels, quantity, quality of performance, cost, and efficiency among others, have to be taken into account. The alternatives selected should, for example, increase the speed of buses, and provide for greater mileage while and not affecting the environment. Here, the DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model) method is used to determine the weights of the criteria and the COPRAS (Complex Proportional Assessment) method is used to calculate the ranking of the alternatives. The main objective of this research paper is to select the best alternative, based on environmental safety, CO2 emission level, technical cost, and fuel cost. Thus a better alternative is selected with the selected alternatives and criteria. The results of this research are summarized as follows. These are natural gas ( R2 ) &gt; propane ( R5 ) &gt; biodiesel ( R3 ) &gt; electricity ( R1 ) &gt; ethanol (R4 ). The numeric values of these selected alternatives are R2=1&gt;R5=0.5215&gt;R3=0.4904&gt;R1=0.4887&gt;R4=0.3299. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oil and grease (O&G) in wastewater can be considered as two parts or proportion contained in emulsion which exceeded O&G standard. Most of oil becomes emulsified with water when they pass through grease trap and discharged in the effluents. Thus, it may indicate that either treatment of grease traps or standards for O&G content stipulated in technical memorandum of Water Pollution Control Ordinance (WPCO) do not reflect the actual situation. Existing grease traps should be upgraded to meet the requirements of WPCO. Alternative technologies need to be developed to tackle this unsolved problem. Good management and practices are also important to ensure proper collection and waste recycling rather than just disposing effluent into drains. Collected O&G content can be recycled as valuable products such as biofuel, flotation agent, or other derivatives. This approach not only protects the environment by improving water quality, it also encourages large flow restaurant operators to recycle oil and grease content towards cleaner production. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Homogeneous Fenton reaction using Fe2+/H2O2 represents a green conventional alternative for lignocellulose pretreatment, but some disadvantages such as time-consuming, acidic pH, and forming iron-based sludge limit its application. Here we present an Iron Oxychloride (FeOCl)-based heterogeneous Fenton method to pretreat corn stover (CS, an abundant agriculture waste), which can be a promising approach to overcome the limitation of Fe2+/H2O2-based homogeneous Fenton pretreatment (FP). The reducing sugars yield of CS treated by this approach for 6 h was about 3 times higher than that of untreated CS and also that of CS treated by FP for 72 h. Compared with the need of low pH by FP, the pH required for FeOCl-based heterogeneous Fenton pretreatment (HFP) can be extended to the range of neutral yet maintaining similar pretreatment output. In addition, the FeOCl catalyst can be easily recovered, and its catalytic activity remains 90% even after repeated use for five times, thus reducing the production of iron-based sludge as a by-product in the pretreatment process. Our results shed light on developing a mild, clean, and low-cost pretreatment strategy for efficient lignocellulose biorefinery. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A food waste treating system was proposed in this study by combining biochar-assisted high-solid anaerobic digestion and subsequent steam gasification of the digestate. The effect of solid level, biochar dosage in anaerobic digestion on the properties of biogas, syngas, and final biochar products were investigated. Results showed that at a high total solid level and biochar dosage of 25 g/L and 50 g/L, the accumulative methane yield reached 110.3 mL CH4/g VS and 126.7 mL CH4/g VS, respectively. From steam gasification of different digestates under 850 °C for 15 min, a maximum of 34.92 mmol/g for the hydrogen yield and 11.44 MJ/m3 for the higher heating value could be obtained for the syngas. Furthermore, the by-product produced from steam gasification was a nutrient-enriched porous biochar, which was suitable to be used as compost. This study demonstrated a pathway for food waste treating to produce methane-enriched biogas, hydrogen-enriched syngas, and nutrient-enriched biochar. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work aims to convert waste cooking oil (WCO) into biofuel through a catalytic cracking process. The process of catalytic cracking was catalyzed using activated carbon loaded with iron and manganese ions. Cellulosic waste, as an eco-friendly, cheap, and renewable resource, was used to prepare the activated carbon. FTIR, XRD, TGA, differential thermal analysis, and N2-adsorption/desorption investigations were applied to characterize the prepared catalysts. Characterization of the obtained biofuels was established according to ASTM standard specifications. The engine tests of the different blends of biofuels-traditional diesel were performed. The obtained data confirmed that the biofuel blend contained 10% biofuel (B10) decreased the brake-specific fuel consumption from 651 g/kw.h for regular diesel to 554 g/kw, and raised the thermal brake efficiency from 15% to 17.4%. Therefore, a biofuel-petroleum fuel blend at 10% of biofuel can be presented as a promising fuel blend for the petroleum diesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High emissions of particulate matter from diesel engines presents a serious risk to human health and the environment. The addition of oxygenated molecules to diesel fuels has been shown to reduce soot formation during combustion. Polyoxymethylene ethers (POMEs) are a novel class of oxygenated molecules that can be produced from biomass and that have the potential to be used as soot-reducing diesel fuel blendstocks. However, only a few variations of these molecules have been studied thus far, and those that have been characterized present significant disadvantages that could compromise current liquid fuel systems and diesel engines. Using a variety of structure–activity models, we evaluated 67 POMEs to predict the effects of structural variations on important fuel properties. Prediction accuracy was assessed by comparing predictions with measurements for a subset of structures. Nine POME molecules were identified as having potential to reduce soot formation by over 75% compared to conventional diesel fuels while being compatible with current liquid fuel infrastructure, maintaining optimal engine performance, and presenting a minimal risk to the environment. None of these nine POMEs has been previously identified as a potential diesel blendstock. This is the first evaluation of POMEs as a class of molecules and the results guide research on the synthesis, properties, and engine performance of POMEs. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - In the present study, a precharacterized oleaginous microalgal species (Chlorella vulgaris) was exploited for its biomass productivity, lipid yield, and fatty acid analysis under mixotrophic and photoautotrophic conditions. For the purpose, the microalgal biomass was raised mixotrophically as well photoautotrophically. For mixotrophic cultivation, molasses was used as additional source of carbon and energy, while for photoautotrophic cultivation, atmospheric CO2 was the sole source of carbon and energy. The microalgal biomass raised thus was then harvested following 5 days of nitrogen starvation. Mixotrophic cultivation depicted remarkably higher biomass productivity (137.43 ± 13.3 mg L−1 day−1) than that of photoautotrophic cultivation (91.57 ± 7.9 mg L−1 day−1). About 39% (w/w) of total lipid content was obtained from the dried biomass raised mixotrophically. Lipidomic analysis of the extracted oil depicted higher concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (palmitic and oleic acids). The significant availability of polyunsaturated fatty acids (60 mg g−1 of dried algal biomass) ensured the production of high quality biofuel. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - In this study, the development of an environmentally friendly version of hydrogen peroxide – acetic acid (HPAC) pretreatment was investigated and optimized with two different approaches as maximum biofuel production optimization and cost optimization. Central composite design and response surface method were used for the experimental design and data analysis, respectively. In the experimental design, investigated HPAC pretreatment parameters were 50–100 °C reaction temperature, 6–24 h reaction time, 0–2 wt% HAc and 0–2 wt% H2O2. Significant ethanol production enhancement was observed only for the samples pretreated at 100 °C. This increase was due to the enhanced enzyme accessibility by the surface area increment and delignification, which were also revealed in SEM imaging and FTIR analysis. Maximum ethanol production was observed in 2% H2O2, 0% HAc, 24 h, and 100 °C pretreatment conditions as 81.65 mg EtOH/g total solid (TS) (103.49 L EtOH/tonne TS), corresponding 49.55% of the theoretical ethanol yield. Maximum methane production, on the other hand, was observed in 2% HAc, 0% H2O2, 100 °C, 6 h conditions as 363.82 mL CH4/g VS. In terms of net energy production, cost optimum pretreatment (1.87% HAc, 0% H2O2, 50 °C, and 6 h) was found be the most beneficial condition with 67.5% energy recovery. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - By extracting lignin, pulp production can be increased without heavy investments in a new recovery boiler, the typical bottleneck of a pulp mill. The extraction is performed by using 0.20 and 0.15 weight equivalents of CO2 and H2SO4 respectively. Herein, we describe lignin esterification with fatty acids using benign reagents to generate a lignin ester mixable with gas oils. The esterification is accomplished by activating the fatty acid and lignin with acetic anhydride which can be regenerated from the acetic acid recycled in this reaction. The resulting mass balance ratio is fatty acid/lignin/acetic acid (2 : 1 : 0.1). This lignin ester can be hydroprocessed to generate hydrocarbons in gasoline, aviation, and diesel range. A 300-hour continuous production of fuel was accomplished. By recirculating reagents from both the esterification step and applying a water gas shift reaction on off-gases from the hydroprocessing, a favorable overall mass balance is realized. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of the third-generation biomass represented by microalgae can produce biocrude. However, the directly obtained biocrude has a high heteroatom content and a low higher heating value (HHV), which cannot meet the standards of biofuel. In this work, water-insoluble biocrude which was directly gained from microalgae hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) was upgraded under four kinds of solvents (i.e., methanol, ethanol, acetone, and H2O) and one type of catalyst (H2O + Ru/C) at 240-400 °C for 1 h. The results show that the HHV and C and H contents of upgraded bio-oil increased and the O/C ratio decreased significantly after solvent upgrading. The highest upgraded bio-oil yield appeared in the case of ethanol upgrading and reached the maximum value of 82.8 wt % at 360 °C. The upgraded bio-oil yield of acetone upgrading increased from 45.8 to 68.2 wt % as the temperature increased within 240-400 °C. Also, esterification reactions between alcohol and acid in the supercritical system remarkably reduced the content of carboxyl-containing organic matter. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study the techno-economic performances of three possible technologies have been assessed to identify the better one. The studied technologies include: Glycerol enriched CaO catalyzed, Supercritical ethanol, and Solid acid catalyzed processes. The overall study is based on complete process simulations using two commercially known software – Aspen Plus and Super Pro. The complete process layout for each option has been designed based on reasonable assumptions and optimum reaction conditions taken from relevant literatures. The amount and quality of biodiesel and glycerol as well as the amount of biodiesel per amount of feedstock used have been used to assess the relative technical performances among the process alternatives. For economic performance evaluation, the total cost of investment, unit cost of production, internal rate of return, net present value and project payback time have been used. The economic feasibility of each process towards change in production capacity has also been assessed. In addition, the sensitivity of each process scenario for the possible global market fluctuations of inputs and outputs has been evaluated. The glycerol enriched CaO catalyzed option is found to be the most economically feasible option under the given market scenario. All the three options are proved to be good in their technical performances, even though the solid acid catalyzed, and supercritical options are not economically efficient. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Municipal solid waste contains mainly organic wastes that can be a good source for anaerobic digestion. Solid-state anaerobic digestion is an affordable and suitable technique to mitigate the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). However, as the organic loading of OFMSW is high, co-digestion with other materials can improve the system's performance. This study aimed to investigate the performance of the co-digestion of OFMSW and sawdust and study the parameters affecting its performance. Based on the experiments, the optimum sawdust/OFMSW ratio was achieved 1:2 with the methane production of 0.3 L/g VS. In addition, the inoculum-to-substrate ration (I/S) was investigated at 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1 ratios. The best result was obtained at 2:1 ratio with a total methane yield of 0.28 L/g VS. The results also indicated that I/S ratios less than 1:1 led to fatty acid accumulation and acidic pH condition. The effect of total solids content on the co-digestion process was also examined in this study. According to the results, as the total solids increased, the biomethane yield decreased while the biogas content increased. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Biochar derived from residue cornstalk left after anaerobic bio-hydrogen production (RCA-biochar) was confirmed to enhance bio-hydrogen production from cornstalk hydrolysate. However, the role of RCA-biochar in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) during bio-hydrogen production from cornstalk has not yet been revealed. This study therefore aims to fill this knowledge gap. It was observed that with the increase in RCA-biochar concentration from 0 g/L to 10.0 g/L, the maximal cumulative SSF bio-hydrogen yield varied from 24.3 ± 1.1 mL/g-substrate to 154.3 ± 3.6 mL/g substrate under varying pH values – 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0. The increasing bio-hydrogen production was observed to correlate with both RCA-biochar level and initial pH. Batch tests confirmed that the initial pH had an obvious effect an saccharification, while RCA-biochar affected anaerobic fermentation a lot. The findings revealed the role of previously unrecognized RCA-biochar in SSF bio-hydrogen production from cornstalk, which can provide an alternative approach for lignocellulosic bio-hydrogen production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel fuel applications can be found in several sectors, including transport, power generation, industry, and commerce. Biodiesel has a high density, viscosity, and acidity than diesel fuel (B0) due to its characteristics, thus having a different effect on the lubricant side, particularly in the long term. This effect takes the form of an increase in the concentration of metal pollutants, both from friction and corrosion, leading to a decrease in the efficiency of the system. The study shows that Fe, Al, and Cr concentrations on lubricants containing B100 were lower, whereas Cu and Pb metals were higher than those with B20. The results show that the average concentrations of Fe, Al, and Cr metal contaminants in the B100 fuel oil were lower by 28%; 13.5%; and 42%, respectively, while the Cu and Pb metals in lubricants with B100 fuel were 23% and 19% higher, respectively, compared to lubricants with B20 fuels. Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) data shows that in the region of wave numbers 2850 cm−1 to 3000 cm−1, the strong absorption band occurred by showing the-CH group, which comes from the-CH2 and-CH3 groups and is mostly owned by hydrocarbon components. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A combination of biodiesel with hydroxy is expected to be one of the most viable fuels to enhance engine performance besides stringent emission norms. In this study, biodiesel was produced from water hyacinth and injected into the engine along with HHO in a volumetric ratio of 40% (BD40). The test was performed in a 4-stroke cycle, single cylinder, and water cool CI engine to evaluate performance, emission, combustion, and heat loss characteristics. The maximum biodiesel yield of 87% was obtained at 1% KOH, 9:1 M ratio, 500 rpm, and 55 °C for 90 min. The engine results showed that a mixture of hydroxy and biodiesel blends caused an increment of BTE by 12.4% while reducing BSEC by 13.5%, HC by 48% and CO by 21.9% as compared to DF. However, the induction of hydroxy increased NOx emission by 47.3% at full operational mode. The peak HHR, peak cylinder pressure, and ID were higher for hydroxy operated engine. The supplementation of hydroxy increased heat loss through the cooling water, and the exhaust. Thus, the present investigation has proved that the induction of hydroxy with BD40 in the CI engine improves performance and reduces exhaust emission like CO and HC except for NOx. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, the implications of the use of hydrogen on product yield and conversion efficiency as well as on economic performance of a hydrogen enhanced Biomass-to-Liquid (BtL) process are analyzed. A process concept for the synthesis of fuel (gasoline and LPG) from biomass-derived synthesis gas via Methanol-to-Gasoline (MtG) route with utilization of carbon dioxide from gasification by feeding additional hydrogen is developed and modeled in Aspen Plus. The modeled process produces 0.36 kg fuel per kg dry straw. Additionally, 99 MW electrical power are recovered from purge and off gases from fuel synthesis in CCGT process, covering the electricity consumption of fuel synthesis and synthesis gas generation. The hydrogen enhanced BtL procces reaches a combined chemical and electrical efficiency of 48.2% and overall carbon efficiency of 69.5%. The total product costs (TPC) sum up to 3.24 €/kg fuel. Raw materials (hydrogen and straw) make up the largest fraction of TPC with a total share of 75%. The hydrogen enhanced BtL process shows increased chemical, energy and carbon efficiencies and thus higher product yields. However, economic analysis shows that the process is unprofitable under current conditions due to high costs for hydrogen provision. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The aim of the present paper is to compare the combustion results of two solid biofuels suitable for industrial applications: olive tree pruning (OTP) pellets and sunflower husk (SH) pellets. The former derives from the thin prunings, along with the leaves, whereas the latter derives as a byproduct from the sunflower oil extraction industries. The combustion was performed in operating conditions at two industrial fixed bed biomass boilers (1.16 MWth capacity each) with a common flue gas stack used for greenhouse heating. Combustion tests were performed at the industrial boiler for two consecutive days. During the first day, the OTP pellets were combusted and monitored for emissions, whereas in the second day the reference fuel that is normally used in the plant (SH pellets) was monitored. While combusting OTP pellets, the boiler's performance was found to exhibit a slightly worse, leading to a decrease of 3.5% points of the boiler efficiency compared to SH pellets. Lower emissions of CO and NOx were also observed for OTP pellets, while the ash formation exhibited signs of reduced slagging. Dust emissions were high for both fuels, indicating that particle emission abatement equipment should be installed at the facility. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) generated by residential wood combustion is a major environmental concern in Europe. This study focuses on the influence of potassium chloride (KCl) on fine particle emissions from a modern wood stove. Wood logs with and without KCl impregnation were subjected to batch combustion and emission measurements. A bi-modal particle number-size distribution characterized by a nucleation mode and an accumulation mode was identified for all types of wood fuel. However, in the presence of KCl, a lower number emission of ultrafine particles and a higher number emission of larger particles (size ∼200–500 nm) were observed. In addition, the emission factor of condensed organic compounds (COC) increased with increasing KCl content, from 0.16 g/kg dry wood for normal wood (NW) to 0.48 g/kg dry wood for wood impregnated with the 2 mol/L KCl solution (HKW), most likely due to the facilitated heterogeneous condensation of semi-volatile hydrocarbons on pre-existing ash particles. In addition, the emission factor of soot particles also increased slightly when the KCl content was high, from 1.47 g/kg dry wood for NW to 2.23 g/kg dry wood for HKW. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wastewater with rich nutrients has been considered as a promising resource to replace artificial culture media in the production of low-cost microalgae biofuels. However, to compete with the traditional fossil energy, the corresponding algal lipid productivity needs to be improved. In this study, iron and acetate supplements were used to improve the lipid productivity of Chlorella pyrenoidosa in actual municipal wastewater (MW). The results showed that, simultaneously adding proper amounts of iron and acetate remarkably increased the microalga dry cell weight (DCW), lipid content and lipid productivity, respectively by 185%, 248% and 671%. Moreover, the addition of acetate increased the saturation degree of the alga based fatty acid methyl esters (P < 0.05), thus improved the quality of the algal lipid with better oxidative stability. Besides, the algal phosphorus utilization efficiency (PUE) was also greatly enhanced by the acetate supplement (P < 0.05), with the conversion efficiencies of phosphorus to algal DCW and lipid in mixotrophic cultures being more than twice of those in the corresponding phototrophic cultures. Finally, a bio-formation of β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) by the microalga was reported, indicating potential phosphorus recovery by microalgae-driven bio-production of phosphorus-containing products combined with phosphorus removal in wastewaters. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to the inertness and structural complexity of lignin, upgrading lignin to biofuels and fine chemicals still faces great challenges. In this paper, a one-pot method was used to catalyze straw lignin with H-ZSM-5 supported by Ni and Ru bimetals, and the lignin conversion rate reached 88.1%. The yield of monophenol was 19.5%, of which the yield of 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol was 4.9% and 3.8%, respectively. The 2D HSQC NMR analysis confirmed that the Ni–Ru/H-ZSM-5 catalyst had an obvious activity of breaking Cβ-O bonds before and after the reaction. The result showed that after loading metal Ni and Ru, the Lewis acid of the catalytic system was greatly increased, which caused electron transfer between Ni and Ru. 3Ni-1.5Ru/H-ZSM-5 had the strongest activity due to the largest synergy among Ni, Ru and H-ZSM-5. The synergy was the key factor leading to the cleavage of C–C and C–O bonds in straw lignin and the high-performance catalytic degradation of lignin. Besides, the effect of reaction solvent and hydrogen resource on upgrading lignin to fine chemicals over 3Ni-1.5Ru/HZSM-5 catalyst was also intensively investigated. This research developed a method for the direct conversion of lignin into valuable monophenols. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-based isobutanol has attracted more and more attention due to its wide application and excellent fuel performance. Compared with ethanol, isobutanol has higher energy density, lower oxygen content, and hygroscopicity, making it an ideal gasoline additive or substitute. Bio-based isobutanol has been commercially produced from a variety of renewable feedstock, including corn, wheat, sorghum, barley, and sugar cane by using a yeast biocatalyst. The existing facility of ethanol plants is acquired to separate and purify isobutanol from the fermentation broth, meaning that the energy-intensive distillation process still cannot be replaced. There are still some challenges in the production of bio-based isobutanol, such as low product concentration, unexpected impurities, high separation cost, thus the development of an efficient and low-cost downstream separation process has become one of the keys to the industrial production of bio-based isobutanol. The separation methods for isobutanol recovery, including vacuum evaporation, adsorption, pervaporation, gas stripping, solvent extraction, salting-out, salting-out extraction, are summarized in this review. An outlook on the challenges and opportunities of isobutanol separation is also described in this review. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is an important biomass-derived platform chemical used to produce polymers, biofuels, and other valuable industrial chemicals. In this work, 5-HMF was synthesized from biomass-derived fructose through a continuous flow process using heterogeneous solid acid catalysts. Different solid acid catalysts, including niobium-based catalysts, Amberlyst 15, and Amberlyst 36, were tested for selective dehydration of fructose to 5-HMF in a biphasic (H2O/MIBK) continuous-flow tubular reactor. The catalysts were characterized using complementary techniques, including BET surface area, XRD, TGA, NH3-TPD, FT-IR, and pyridine-FT-IR. We also studied the effects of different reaction parameters such as the initial fructose concentration, reaction temperature, feeding flow rate, and aqueous-to-organic phase ratio. The optimal conditions were determined to be 150 °C temperature, a 0.25 ml min-1 feeding flow rate, 200 mg ml-1 NaCl concentration, 200 and 400 mg ml-1 fructose concentrations, and aqueous-to-organic phase ratios of 1 : 5 and 1 : 10. In addition, niobium phosphate (NbP), synthetic sulphated niobia (NbS) and Amberlyst 36 (Amb. 36) were active and selective, leading to 5-HMF yields in the range of 54-60% under the optimal operating conditions. Meanwhile, the Amb. 36 catalyst exhibited a 5-HMF selectivity of 70% at 150 °C, and therefore it was selected as the catalyst for the fructose dehydration reaction. Additionally, the Amb. 36 catalyst showed consistent catalytic activity and selectivity during a time-on-stream of 8 h. Furthermore, a reusability test with the used catalyst demonstrated that this catalyst can be recycled and reused without losing its catalytic activity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

AB  - Given the economic and environmental advantages of using Waste Fried Oil (WFO) as a starting material, this investigation explores the conversion of WFO to Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) via electrolysis for use in waste. In electrolysis, hydroxyl ions are generated from water in close proximity to the cathode. When hydroxyl ions react with methanol, they produce a species of nucleophilic methoxide which is the main actor in converting WFO into FAME. This study specifically investigates the effects of voltage, catalyst concentration, co solvent amount, rotation speed, and molar ratio of methanol to WFO in electrolytic transesterification converting WFO into FAME using graphite electrodes in the presence of a heterogeneous, catalytic zeolite–chitosan composite. With an alcohol to WFO molar ratio of 8:1, 1 wt% zeolite-chitosan composite concentration at 40 V in the presence of 2 wt% H2O of the whole solution at room temperature and stirrer rate of 400 rpm and reaction time of 30 min, a 96.5% yield of FAME was achieved. Characterization of physical and biodiesel fuel properties was performed using American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) methods. The biocomposite was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), X–ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET), Thermogravimetric analysis (TG), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X–ray spectrometry (EDX). Finally, the physical properties of FAME produced under optimal conditions were studied using Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS), FTIR, surface tension, and viscosity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Most edible plants used for biofuel production need agricultural lands with freshwater resources, leading to the land crisis in near future. Thus, the halophyte plants which can grow in highly saline lands and tolerate seawater salinity are considered recently. In this work, the production of surfactant-free microemulsion hybrid biofuels according to the extracted oil from two types of halophytic salicornia plants and employing different eco-friendly oxygenated ethanolotropes are investigated to replace fossil fuels. According to the results of low temperature phase behavior, salicornia oil shows good low temperature phase behavior and is quite suitable for biofuel formulation. The nanostructures of the produced biofuels are characterized by dynamic light scattering, small angle X-ray scattering and electrical conductivity. The mean droplet size of all samples were in the range of 0.99 to 22.62 nm which corresponds to the IUPAC standard. According to electrical conductivity results, a large region of ethanol in oil structure can be seen along dilution lines at different weight fractions of additive to salicornia oil which are in agreement with zeta potential and dynamic light scattering results. The presented technique leads to the production of new green biofuels considering the worldwide freshwater shortage. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The massive generation of spent coffee ground wastes has become an environmental concern around the world. Thus, in this research work, spent coffee grounds of Coffea arabica species were evaluated as potential feedstock for solid biofuel production to reduce solid waste and to generate value products. Pyrolysis temperature, pyrolysis time and heating rate were the dominating factors affecting the biochar and energy yields from the response surface methodology analysis. The spent coffee ground biochar (SCG-biochar) was then optimised of its pyrolysis parameters, with promising biochar yield (29.94%) and high energy yield (41.60%). The optimised SCG-biochar was characterised and found to possess favourable fuel characteristics such as high carbon percentage (80.35%), low oxygen percentage (12.43%), low H/C ratio (0.44), low O/C (0.12) and high fuel ratio (6.75), which will contribute to higher energy generation and lesser emission of greenhouse gases. The optimised SCG-biochar possessed high thermal efficiencies with low activation energies (63.24 kJ mol−1 –122.93 kJ mol−1) with attractive unit cost of $ 7.22 per kg which can be used in combustion process effectively. Therefore, the fuel and combustion characteristics of SCG-biochar signifies a promising development of feasible biofuels for energy generation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thermochemical pretreatment is one of the key steps to process lignocellulosic biomass for production of biofuels and biomaterials. γ-valerolactone (GVL) has been used as a green and renewable solvent to efficiently dissolve lignin under acidic conditions and enhance subsequent enzyme digestibility. Further improvement is still required to lower the pretreatment temperature in order to reduce sugar degradation and irreversible lignin condensation, as well as the capital cost. In this study, we compared the use of HCl and H2SO4 as catalysts during GVL pretreatment, and found the performance of GVL-HCl at 100 °C was comparable to that of GVL-H2SO4 at 120 °C in terms of xylan and lignin removal and enzyme digestibility. We further monitored the lignin removal and cellulose accessibility in the cell walls at different pretreatment time points by imaging the changes in lignin auto-fluorescence and in CtCBM3-GFP binding with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), respectively. We found GVL-HCl pretreatment at a relative low temperature (100 °C) could rapidly remove lignin in the compound middle lamella and cell corner areas, which concurred with the increase of CtCBM3-GFP binding in these areas. Real-time imaging of cell wall degradation by cellulases further revealed that the secondary cell walls could be digested from both cell lumen and CML sides, and eventually fully deconstructed within 24 h. Our results provide new insight into the effects of chloride anions on plant cell wall structure during GVL pretreatment, and offer potential routes to further optimize and enhance the efficiency of GVL-based pretreatment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of hydroxymethylfurfural was investigated in a three-phase batch reactor over a range of reaction temperatures (170–230 °C), under 5 MPa of hydrogen, and tetrahydrofuran solvent. Nickel-based carbon-supported catalysts were also promoted by lanthanum and niobium, despite promoters alone demonstrated no activity. Based on experimentally-obtained liquid products, a reaction pathway was proposed and a microkinetic model was established, by considering adsorption, desorption and surface reaction kinetics, mass transfer and thermodynamics. An unpromoted Ni/C resulted in primarily unsaturated furan diol, a highly desirable intermediate in the polymer industry. As reaction temperatures increased > 200 °C, dehydration yielded deoxygenated products suitable for solvents and biofuel. In spite of enhancements to reducibility, La-promotion significantly decreased both hydrogenation (8-times) and deoxygenation (25-times) rate constants. Alternatively, Nb-incorporation offered additional acidity, while lower activation energies resulted in 200% higher deoxygenation rates via dehydration reactions and humin formation at lower temperatures. It exhibited the highest deoxygenation activity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study was the investigation of the effect of growth conditions of energy willow (Salix viminalis L.) on its physical and chemical parameters towards lignocellulosic biofuels. This work is linked to the global trend of replacing fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) with energy and renewable fuels. This energy transition is dictated by the reduction of the human-induced greenhouse effect (to the greatest extent by industrial development). Changing from traditional to renewable energy sources results in industry becoming less dependent on fuels whose sources are beginning to run out, and in energy processing being broken down into smaller sectors with greater flexibility to change and less susceptibility to failure. The use of lignocellulosic raw materials such as wood, straw, food industry waste, wood, and post-consumer products such as old furniture for energy purposes allows the use of substances which bind the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in their cellular structure during growth. In order to optimise the costs of producing such energy and minimise its impact on the environment, these plants should be located as close as possible to the source of raw materials. One of the most important characteristics for the profitability of energy production from woody biomass is a high biomass yield. For this purpose, the raw material used for this study was energy willow (Salix viminalis L.) seedlings, which are often used for energy crops. Due to the moisture-loving nature of the substrate, the effect of the addition of the active substance prednisonum as a catalyst for water adsorption from the substrate was investigated. In order to determine the substances formed during the thermal decomposition of energy willow (Salix viminalis L.) wood, a pyrolysis process was carried out at 450 °C using pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (PY/GC-MS). © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Plastics are one of the major pollutants to the environment. An investigation is carried out in converting low density polyethylene (LDPE) to oil by pyrolysis method with the aid of catalyst for the use in internal combustion engines. Experiments were conducted at different speeds (1200, 1500 and 1800 rpm) and variable loads (low, medium and full) with constant compression ratio engine to evaluate the performance and ecological parameters. Plastic pyrolyzed oil (PPO) is blended with diesel fuel in 20:80 volume proportion to get D80PO20 blended mixture which is employed in engine in order to assess its characteristics. Encouraging outcomes have been obtained as cylinder pressure in combustion is of same order as that of diesel fueled engine. The results showed that increasing engine speeds resulted in higher cylinder pressure and brake thermal efficiency. Also, high nitrogen oxide (NOX) and low brake specific energy consumption (BSFC) has been identified. Lower smoke (BSN) and NOX emissions are noticed from engine tail pipe with D80PO20 blended mixture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The novel Na-SiO2@TiO2 heterogeneous base catalyst was designed and successfully applied to the trans-esterification reaction of waste cooking oil for sustainable biodiesel production. The designed catalyst was characterized by SEM, XPS, FT-IR and BET before treatment, illustrated its suitability for the catalytic trans-esterification reaction. Moreover, the influence of reaction temperature, time, catalyst concentration and WCO:MeOH molar ratio on the catalytic activity were also investigated, resultant 98% biodiesel yield was achieved. The reusability test demonstrated that the Na-SiO2@TiO2 catalyst has noticeable catalytic potency up to 5 successive runs. Besides, the kinetics study explains that the reaction is kinetically controlled by pseudo 1st order. The Ea was found to be 21.65 kJ/mol. Similarly, the important thermodynamic parameters such as ΔH#, ΔS# and ΔG# were estimated to be 18.52 kJ.mol−1, −219.17 J.mol−1K−1 and 92.59 kJ.mol−1 respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential of new trimetallic (Ce, Cu, La) loaded montmorillonite clay catalyst for synthesizing biodiesel using novel non-edible Celastrus paniculatus Willd seed oil via two-step transesterification reaction has been reported along with catalyst characterization. Transesterification reaction was optimized and maximum biodiesel yield of 89.42% achieved under optimal operating reaction states like; 1:12 oil to methanol ratio, 3.5% of catalyst amount, 120 °C of reaction temperature for 3 h. The predicted and experimental biodiesel yields under these reaction conditions were 89.42 and 89.40%, which showing less than 0.05% variation. Additionally, optimum biodiesel yield can be predicted by drawing 3D surface plots and 2D contour plots using MINITAB 17 software. For the characterization of the obtained biodiesel, analysis including the GC/MS, FT-IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR were applied. The fuel properties of obtained biodiesel agrees well with the different European Union (EU-14214), China (GB/T 20828), and American (ASTM-951, 6751) standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As a kind of industrial hazardous solid waste, paper mill sludge (PMS) was hard to treated by conventional process because of its high moisture, high organic content and and high environmental risk. The hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) shows excellent potential for the conversion to a wide variety of organic matter with high water contents including various kinds sludge into fuels or value-added chemicals. In this paper, the liquefaction potential for PMS under different reaction temperatures were investigated, and the products were classified into several main components based on the results of GC-MS. The results showed that the highest yield of bio-oil was 44 % (wt/wt dry PMS without ash) at 340 °C with simply compound composition. And the bio-oil product has above 26 % long chain hydrocarbon and 22 % cycloketones. It has potential for conversion to biomass platform compounds. It can be used as bio-fuel for heat recovery of alkali recovery system of paper mill. So, adjusting different reaction temperatures of HTL, the properties of products can meet the different requirements for platform chemical and/or bio-oil fuel. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Walnut shell pyrolysis liquefaction experiments for phenolic enrichment were conducted using torrefaction pretreatment and fractional condensation simultaneously. Bio-oil composition was comprehensively analyzed for elements, functional groups and componential contents. After high-temperature torrefaction, the proportion of lignin pyrolytic products in pyrolysis organic vapors showed significant increment. Fractional condensation further separated water, acetic acid and other small molecular compounds, and improved the phenolic content in the target bio-oil. Compared with the traditional pyrolysis liquefaction technology, when 363 K water bath was utilized to recover 300 °C torrefied walnut shell pyrolysis vapors, the C/O ratio in bio-oil increased from 0.5 to 1.6, and the proportions of H in aromatic ring and phenolic OH increased by 150% and 400%, respectively. The total content of detectable phenols was enriched from 2.7 wt% to 13.3 wt%. The optimized scheme on improving economic efficiency was provided for offsetting torrefaction energy consumption and low bio-oil yield. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) activity of NiMo catalysts have been evaluated in the presence of catalyst poisons in bio-based feedstocks. An in-house synthesized NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst was placed in a refinery unit for biofuel production. Iron (Fe), phosphorus (P) and metals were identified as major contaminants. Calcination treatment was explored to recover the activity of spent catalysts. The effect of Fe, K and phospholipid containing P and Na on catalyst deactivation during hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid was simulated at lab-scale. Fe caused the most deactivation where the highest feed concentration of the Fe compound resulted in 1480 ppm Fe deposited on the catalyst. Elemental distribution along the radial axis of spent catalysts indicated: Fe deposited only to a depth of 100 μm irrespective of concentration while P and Na from phospholipid and K penetrated deeper in catalyst particles with a distribution profile that was found to be concentration dependent. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Solid amine adsorbents are among the most promising CO2 adsorption technologies for biogas upgrading due to their high selectivity toward CO2, low energy consumption, and easy regeneration. However, in most cases, these adsorbents undergo severe chemical inactivation due to urea formation when regenerated under a realistic CO2 atmosphere. Herein, we demonstrated a facile and efficient synthesis route, involving the synthesis of nano-Al2O3 support derived from coal fly ash with a CO2 flow as the precipitant and the preparation of polyethylenimine (PEI)-impregnated Al2O3-supported adsorbent. The optimal 55%PEI@2%Al2O3 adsorbent showed a high CO2 uptake of 139 mg·g-1 owing to the superior pore structure of synthesized nano-Al2O3 support and exhibited stable cyclic stability with a mere 0.29% decay per cycle even under the realistic regenerated CO2 atmosphere. The stabilizing mechanism of PEI@nano-Al2O3 adsorbent was systematically demonstrated, namely, the cross-linking reaction between the amidogen of a PEI molecule and nano-Al2O3 support, owing to the abundant Lewis acid sites of nano-Al2O3. This cross-linking process promoted the conversion of primary amines into secondary amines in the PEI molecule and thus significantly enhanced the cyclic stability of PEI@nano-Al2O3 adsorbents by markedly inhibiting the formation of urea compounds. Therefore, this facile and efficient strategy for PEI@nano-Al2O3 adsorbents with anti-urea properties, which can avoid active amine content dilution from PEI chemical modification, is promising for practical biogas upgrading and various CO2 separation processes. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, walnut shells and bio-oil distillation residues were co-pyrolyzed at varying ratios (i.e. 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1) and the resulting bio-oils were collected via fractional condensation. Furthermore, the effect of lyophilization on the collected bio-oils was analyzed. The results indicated that the temperature of fractional condensation effectively controlled the co-pyrolytic oil yield in first condenser, while the total bio-oil yield and condensation efficiency were dominated by the co-pyrolytic blend mass ratios. Meanwhile, the lower ratio of mixed walnut shell and higher condensation temperature would improve the element distribution of bio-oil, namely weakened oxygen content and intensified carbon content. Moreover, the introduction of bio-oil distillation residue not only decreased the content of carboxylic acids in co-pyrolytic oils, but also accelerated the conversion of lignin oligomers to aromatic monomers. The product distribution of fractional co-pyrolytic oil was also improved, in which the total detectable phenols enhanced to 9.73 wt% (with a maximum increase of 22.79 times). Additionally, lyophilization had a positive effect on separation and purification of aqueous bio-oil, endowing 4.79–10.81 times enhancement of detectable phenols and exhibiting a maximum increase of furfural content as surprising 2.22 wt%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Steam co-gasification of banana peel with other biomass, i.e., Japanese cedar wood, rice husk and their mixture, was carried out for the hydrogen-rich gas production in a fixed-bed reactor. For the co-gasification process, the banana peels were physically mixed with rice husk, Japanese cedarwood and their mixture respectively by different mixing weight ratios. The effects of reaction temperature and the addition amount of banana peel on the gas production yield were investigated by comparing the experimental data with the calculated ones based on the individual biomass gasification at the same condition. It was found that the banana peel with a high content of alkali and alkaline earth metal (AAEM) species exhibited not only high gasification reactivity but also a significant enhancing catalytic effect on the co-gasification process at the low temperature, especially with the biomass containing no silica species. The high content of silica species in the rice husk had a negative effect on the gasification reactivity of banana peel during the co-gasification since it could hinder the release of AAEM from the biomass and/or lead to the possible formation of inactive alkaline silicates. However, the combination of these three samples with the suitable weight ratio could improve the gasification performance at the low temperature due to the synergetic effect provided by high contents of potassium and calcium from banana peel and cedarwood respectively. Moreover, the addition of calcined seashells as the CaO source could further improve the gas production yield, especially the hydrogen gas yield at a relatively low gasification temperature of 750 ℃. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Liquid transport fuels produced from biomass are of growing importance, due to increasingly ambitious targets for CO2 emissions reduction. However, a mismatching hydrogen-to-carbon ratio in biomass feedstocks, versus that required for conventional fuels, requires that supplementary hydrogen be added or surplus carbon be removed in the production process, with many possible process configurations. Here, we consider these alternative configurations for a process incorporating a supercritical water gasification reactor, syngas reformer and downstream Fischer–Tropsch liquid fuel synthesis unit. The feedstock is microalgae, process heat is supplied using a concentrating solar-thermal collector, and additional hydrogen is supplied from photovoltaics-powered electrolysers. Using a dynamic techno-economic process model to capture solar resource dynamics, configurations are optimised for lowest produced fuel cost. Three syngas reformer types are considered: steam methane reforming (SMR), with solar heat driving the conversion of CH4 into syngas; partial oxidation/dry reforming (PO/DR), with added hydrogen instead serving that same purpose; and autothermal reforming (ATR), combining both H2 and heat. Furthermore, for SMR, both CO2 dumping and H2 addition cases are considered. At present-day 9.72 AUD/kg hydrogen costs, SMR with CO2 dumping is cheapest, yielding gasoline equivalent at 3.76 AUD/L. With cheaper hydrogen, the optimal configuration shifts to SMR with H2 addition, then ATR, then PO/DR, reaching a fuel cost of 2.99 AUD/L at H2 cost of 2.1 AUD/kg. The design of future biofuels processes will depend greatly on the cost of hydrogen. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel production via pyrolysis has received increasing interest as a promising solution for utilization of now wasted food residue. In this study, the fast pyrolysis of mixed food waste (MFW) was performed in a bubbling fluidized-bed reactor. This was done under different operating conditions (reaction temperatures and carrier gas flow rate) that influence product distribution and bio-oil composition. The highest liquid yield (49.05 wt%) was observed at a pyrolysis temperature of 475 °C. It was also found that the quality of pyrolysis bio-oils (POs) could be improved using catalysts. The catalytic fast pyrolysis of MFW was studied to upgrade the pyrolysis vapor, using dolomite, red mud, and HZSM-5. The higher heating values (HHVs) of the catalytic pyrolysis bio-oils (CPOs) ranged between 30.47 and 35.69 MJ/kg, which are higher than the HHVs of non-catalytic pyrolysis bio-oils (27.69–31.58 MJ/kg). The major components of the bio-oils were fatty acids, N-containing compounds, and derivatives of phenol. The selectivity for bio-oil components varied depending on the catalysts. In the presence of the catalysts, the oxygen was removed from oxygenates via moisture, CO2, and CO. The CPOs contained aliphatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic compounds (such as naphthalene), pyridine derivatives, and light oxygenates (cyclic alkenes and ketones). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The integration of gasification with syngas fermentation is still in an early stage of development, where many questions exist concerning the syngas quality required. The challenge is to define the gasification conditions that will provide a H2:CO:CO2 ratio suitable for syngas fermentation, as well as to identify and remove the compounds that can inhibit the performance of the microorganisms. The right balance between the gasification conditions and a line up with minimal gas cleaning needs to be assessed to improve the economic feasibility of the process. In this work a first attempt to combine the two processes is presented, with the aim to provide an insight of the indirect gasification, the gas cleaning applied, the effect of the main impurities and the performance of syngas fermentation. A lignin rich feedstock was gasified with steam in an indirect gasifier, at TNO (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research). The gas, after removal of some components that could hinder the performance of the fermentation (tar compounds, BTX, unsaturated hydrocarbons and sulphur compounds), consisted of CO, H2, CO2, CH4, C2H6 and traces of other hydrocarbons. The influence of the obtained syngas quality and composition was evaluated in the fermentation process using Clostridium ljungdahlii, at KIT (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology). For comparison, product gas from beech wood gasification was also evaluated in the fermentation process under the same conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ceria-promoted Co@NC (NC, N doped carbon) catalysts are prepared by pyrolysis of biomass materials. Characterization results indicate that ceria and Co species facilitate the distribution of each other due to the formation of a Ce-O-Co solid solution. The specific surface area of the catalyst increased from 378.77 to 537.7 m2g−1viathe introduction of ceria. The electron transfer from Co to Ce further enhanced their interaction, and Co species facilitate the formation of more defective oxygen vacancies on ceria, which are beneficial to the activities of catalytic hydrogenation and catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH), respectively. Thus, Co/Ce@NC (0.99% Co loading) pyrolyzed at 850 °C exhibits excellent performance in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of vanillin with high metal utilization. Catalytic hydrogenation and CTH coexisted in the presence of H2and ethanol, and &gt;99% yield of creosol can be obtained in each of them. The reaction processes are monitored. No intermediate is found in aqueous media, while ethoxymethyl-4-methoxy-2-phenol is detected in ethanol. Moreover, Co/Ce@NC presents outstanding stability and general applicability. This work provides new insights into the construction of M@NC (M, metal) catalysts and the HDO process of biofuel upgrade. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - The development of chemoselective and heterogeneous earth-abundant metal catalysts is essential for environmentally friendly chemical synthesis. We report a highly efficient, chemoselective, and reusable single-site nickel(II) hydride catalyst based on robust and porous aluminum metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (DUT-5) for hydrogenation of nitro and nitrile compounds to the corresponding amines and hydrogenolysis of aryl ethers under mild conditions. The nickel-hydride catalyst was prepared by the metalation of aluminum hydroxide secondary building units (SBUs) of DUT-5 having the formula of Al(μ2-OH)(bpdc) (bpdc = 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylate) with NiBr2 followed by a reaction with NaEt3BH. DUT-5-NiH has a broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance in the hydrogenation of aromatic and aliphatic nitro and nitrile compounds under 1 bar H2 and could be recycled and reused at least 10 times. By changing the reaction conditions of the hydrogenation of nitriles, symmetric or unsymmetric secondary amines were also afforded selectively. The experimental and computational studies suggested reversible nitrile coordination to nickel followed by 1,2-insertion of coordinated nitrile into the nickel-hydride bond occurring in the turnover-limiting step. In addition, DUT-5-NiH is also an active catalyst for chemoselective hydrogenolysis of carbon-oxygen bonds in aryl ethers to afford hydrocarbons under atmospheric hydrogen in the absence of any base, which is important for the generation of fuels from biomass. This work highlights the potential of MOF-based single-site earth-abundant metal catalysts for practical and eco-friendly production of chemical feedstocks and biofuels. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Effective catalysts are indispensable for the preparation of fuel components from vegetable oils via the one-step hydrothermal method. In this study, the Pt/MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by etching with sulfuric acid, citric acid, or hydrochloric acid. The performance of the obtained Pt/MCM-41 catalysts for the hydrothermal treatment of vegetable oils was evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor using Jatropha oil as a model raw material (temperature = 360°C, liquid hourly space velocity = 1 h−1, hydrogen–oil ratio = 1000, and hydrogen pressure = 4 MPa). The modified catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3, CO chemisorption, and pyridine adsorption infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Furthermore, the selectivity of various fuel components, including C8–C16 alkanes, C8–C16 iso-alkanes, C8–C16 arenes, and C17–C18 alkanes, were analyzed based on the catalyst characteristics. Acid etching was found to decrease the surface area of Al-MCM-41 but increase the amount of acid sites, and among these acids, citric acid was proved as the priority additives, with better catalytic performance. Moreover, this catalyst exhibited the best conversion and the highest C8–C16 and C17–C18 selectivities. © 2020 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Sludge dewatering is a matter of great concern to reduce the volume of sludge, stabilize its organic components, and achieve resource utilization. This study investigates sludge dewatering by microwave torrefaction along with the production of sludge solid biofuel at 480–800 W combined with durations of 5–25 min. Proximate analysis, calorific value analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy observations are employed to evaluate the dewatering degree, fuel properties, and energy efficiency of the torrefaction process. The independent parallel reaction (IPR) model and particle swarm optimization (PSO) analysis are also adopted for sludge pyrolysis kinetics calculation. The results show that microwave torrefaction is efficient for sludge dewatering with a short duration. The produced sludge solid biofuel is similar to stone-like coal, and can be used for civil or industrial boilers after flotation or just co-firing with briquette. The ash content of sludge solid biofuel shows a declining trend and the surface characteristics change from smooth to rough and fluffy with increasing the torrefaction severity. The bio-oil is mainly composed of phenols, siloxanes, and cholesterol. In addition, hydrogen is detected in the torgas. Furthermore, it is found that lower torrefaction power with a shorter duration yields a higher energy efficiency of the torrefaction process. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is an advanced technology for efficient treatment of organic wastewater and recovery of new energy, with the advantages and disadvantages of single-chamber and dual-chamber MES reactors being less understood. Therefore, we explored the effects of single-chamber and dual-chamber structures on the methane production performance and microbial community structure of MES. Results indicated that methane concentration and current density of single-chamber MES were higher than those of dual-chamber MES, and the system stability was better, while chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate and cumulative methane production were not significantly different. Analysis of microbial community structure showed the abundance of acidogens and H2-producing bacteria was higher in single-chamber MES, while fermentation bacteria and methanogens was lower. The abundance of methanogens of dual-chamber MES (21.74–24.70%) was superior to the single-chamber MES (8.23–10.10%). Moreover, in dual-chamber MES, methane was produced primarily through acetoclastic methanogenic pathway, while in single-chamber MES cathode, methane production was mainly by hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway. Information provided will be useful to select suitable reactors and optimize reaction design. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - γ-Valerolactone (GVL), which can be generated from levulinic acid (LA), has attained a humongous amount of interest due to its implantation in various fields, which includes fuels and fuel additives. Herein, for the first time, we have sequentially synthesized silver-cobalt core-shell nanoalloy-based catalysts through a simple wet impregnation method for selective conversion of LA to GVL. The highest catalytic proficiency (97.3 LA conversion with 100% GVL selectivity) had been achieved over a composition-graded optimized catalyst, named 5Ag-15Co, under comparatively moderate reaction conditions (150 °C, 1 MPa H2 pressure). The catalyst structure-activity relationship has been established through an extensive range of in situ spectroscopic characterizations, which included in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ CO-diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy, and in situ attenuated total reflection-inferred (ATR-IR) spectroscopy. The extraordinary catalytic activity could be attributed to the modulation of electronic properties, which is mainly due to the synergistic interaction in the core-shell alloy system, as confirmed from in situ XPS studies. The presence of the highest amount of metallic cobalt in the 5Ag-15Co catalyst, which was evidenced by both in situ XPS and in situ CO-DRIFT, could assist the hydrogenation step in hydrodeoxygenation of LA to GVL. This finding also was emphasized by H2 chemisorption analysis, which revealed the presence of the highest active metal surface area in the 5Ag-15Co catalyst. In situ ATR-IR has elucidated that moderate interaction, which was generated between the catalyst and LA, has enhanced the rate of reaction. This finding also has been emphasized by the results obtained from NH3-TPD analysis, which revealed that the presence of high surface density of Lewis/weak acidic sites facilitated the hydrogenation step in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction. The detailed kinetic analysis revealed that the 5Ag-15Co catalyst had the lowest activation energy (41.34 kJ) among its counterparts, which accelerated the reaction rate. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Given the scarceness of fossil fuels and high volume of pollution caused through the consumption of these fuels, many efforts are being made to produce alternative fuels. Biodiesel is one of the alternatives to diesel fuels. The main problem with biodiesel production is higher operation costs, as compared with diesel fuels. In this study, waste cooking oil and cow bone as the catalyst were used to reduce feed costs as much as possible. Moreover, a microreactor was utilized to reduce the residence time to 1 min. Using Box-Behnken design method, the effect of different variables including catalyst concentration (calcined cow bone), oil to methanol volume ratio, residence time, and reaction temperature on the purity of produced biodiesel were examined. The results showed that when using a catalyst concentration of 8.5 wt %, an oil to methanol volume ratio of 2.25 vol: vol, a residence time of 60 s, and a temperature of 63.1 °C, the maximum purity of biodiesel was 99.24%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main components of municipal solid waste (MSW) include food waste (FW) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which present an opportunity to convert energy or value-added products through low-temperature synergetic pyrolysis. In this study, the characteristics of char and bio-oil derived from MSW, FW and PVC feedstocks via pyrolysis at relatively low temperatures (200–300 °C) for 60 min were investigated. The results revealed that the transformation of PVC to HCl gas production started at a temperature of ＞ 200 °C. The oxygenated carbon groups on the char surface were decomposed at elevated reaction temperatures. The relative molecular mass of bio-oil derived from FW increased when PVC-derived char was used as a catalyst at 250 °C. In addition, active functional groups and pore structures were formed through synergistic pyrolysis. This work provides information regarding the possible route underlying the network of char and bio-oil production from the synergistic conversion of FW and PVC-derived char. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Glycerol availabity, a waste generated in the production of biodiesel, has increased during last years. In this work, Chemical Looping Reforming (CLR) of glycerol has been demonstrated in a 1 kWth continuous unit during 35 h using a Ni-based oxygen carrier to obtain a high purity syngas without CO2 emissions. Complete conversion of the glycerol and syngas composition close to thermodynamic equilibrium was obtained in the fuel reactor. Moreover, pure N2 was obtained as product in the air reactor. The influence of the main operating variables on the composition and flow rates of synthesis gas was evaluated. The oxygen-to-glycerol molar ratio was the main parameter since the amount of lattice oxygen transferred by the oxygen carrier in the fuel reactor controlled the syngas composition. The increase of the water-to-glycerol ratio produced an increase in the production of H2 and CO2 with a decrease in the CO content, increasing both the syngas yield and the H2/CO molar ratio in the gas. Fuel reactor temperature affected mainly to the CH4 content, being lower as higher was the temperature. Close to autothermal conditions, it is possible to obtain a syngas composed by H2 ≈ 48–50 vol%; CO ≈ 30–35 vol%; CO2 ≈ 14–18 vol%; and CH4 ≈ 1.6–3 vol%. In addition, different H2/CO ratios can be obtained by modifying the H2O/glycerol ratio and temperature. A H2/CO ratio of 2 could be reached using either a H2O/glycerol ratio of 1.5 at 750 °C or a H2O/glycerol ratio of 2 at 800 °C. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel is an eco-friendly alternative source for the depleting fossil fuel resources. The catalytic conversion of biomass into biofuel is an emerging technique in biofuel production. In this study, iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized from Spinacia oleracea by green synthesis method and subsequently sulfonated to produce active nanocatalyst material. The catalyst obtained has high acid activity and can be readily recovered by an external magnetic field. Corncob waste was crushed to powder form and is subjected to pretreatment by ultrasonication. The compositional analysis was carried out using the Soxhlet extraction method to estimate the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents. The functional group of biomass and morphology changes were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The active nanocatalyst was tested for the hydrolysis of corncob into sugar. The effects of catalyst dosage and temperature on sugar yield were studied. The reducing sugar yield was measured using the dinitrosalicylic acid test. The production of bioethanol from sugar hydrolysate was carried out using a simultaneous saccharification route. A reference sample and the sample with a high yield of reducing sugar were taken into the fermentation process, which was done using Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast; this yeast was initially cultured in the YPD medium, and the grown yeast was used in the fermentation process for the production of bioethanol, whose yield was confirmed using GC analysis. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The manufacture of goods from oil, coal, or gas to everyday onsumer products comprises in more or less all cases at least one catalytic tep. Compared to conventional hydrothermal catalysis, electrocatalysis ossesses the advantage of mild operational conditions and high selectivity, yet the potential energy savings and climate change mitigation have rarely een assessed. This study conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) for the lectrocatalytic oxidation of crude glycerol to produce lactic acid, one of the ost common platform chemicals. The LCA results demonstrated a 31% eduction in global warming potential (GWP) compared to the benchmark (bio-and chemocatalytic) processes. Additionally, electrocatalysis yielded a ynergetic potential to mitigate climate change depending on the scenario. For example, electrocatalysis combined with a low-carbon-intensity grid can educe GWP by 57% if the process yields lactic acid and lignocellulosic iofuel as compared to a conventional fossil-based system with functionally equivalent products. This illustrates the potential of lectrocatalysis as an important contributor to climate change mitigation across multiple industries. A technoeconomic analysis (TEA) for electrocatalytic lactic acid production indicated considerable challenges in economic feasibility due to the significant pfront capital cost. This challenge could be largely addressed by enabling dual redox processing to produce separate streams of enewable chemicals and biofuels simultaneously. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of lignin was examined at various temperature (250–310 °C) and reaction time in the presence of different solvents (water, methanol and ethanol) with different metal supported on MCM-41 mesoporous catalyst. In case of ethanol solvent, the maximum bio-oil yield of 56.2 wt% was obtained with Ni-Al/MCM-41. However in case of water, bio-oil yield was (44.3 wt%); while significantly improves bio-oil yield for methanol solvent (48.1 wt%). It is indicated that alcoholic solvents promoted the lignin decomposition, while in the presence of catalyst; water solvent significantly improves lignin degradation. Loading of Ni and Al on MCM-41, the acid strength of the catalyst increased, which enhanced lignin degradation. From the GC–MS analysis, the main G-type (ca.54%) phenolic compounds were produced with higher percentage of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds. CHNS and GPC analysis showed that catalytic liquefaction encouraged hydrodeoxygenation, which produced lower oxygen content bio-oil with lower molecular weight. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work investigated the impact of pyrolysis medium and catalyst on the production of bio-BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) from Quercus Mongolica (Q. Mongolica) via catalytic pyrolysis. Two different pyrolysis media (N2 and CH4) and five different zeolite catalysts (HY, HBeta, HZSM-5, 1 wt% Ni/HZSM-5, and 1 wt% Ga/HZSM-5) were considered for the Q. Mongolica pyrolysis. The HZSM-5 yielded more BTX than the HY and HBeta due to its strong acidity. The employment of CH4 as the pyrolysis medium improved the BTX yield (e.g., 2.7 times higher total BTX yield in CH4 than in N2) and resulted in low coke yield (e.g., 5.27% for N2-pyrolysis and 2.57% for CH4-pyrolysis) because the CH4-drived hydrogen simulated a hydropyrolysis condition and facilitated dehydroaromatization reaction. CH4 also led to direct coupling, Diels-Alder, and co-aromatization reactions during the pyrolysis, contributing to enhancing the BTX yield. The addition of Ga to the HZSM-5 could further increase the BTX yield by means of facilitating hydrocracking/demethylation and methyl radical formation from CH4 assisting the generation of &gt;C2 alkenes that could be further converted into BTX on acid sites of the HZSM-5. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In line with the aim to minimize climate change and dependence on fossil fuels, there is an increasing demand from different transport sectors for non-oxygenated and low-cost biofuels. In this study, bio-hydrocarbons were synthesized from macauba oils, which is a new and promising biofuel feedstock. These fatty materials were subjected to deoxygenation reactions over beta zeolite and ZSM-5 catalysts with different acidities (Si/Al ratio). Other parameters such as the reaction atmosphere (N2 or H2), catalyst calcination time, feedstock composition, and reaction time were also investigated. A preliminary study of the deoxygenation reaction kinetics indicated a higher conversion rate of hydrocarbons using beta zeolite, achieving a conversion of 100% in 3 h. The products were categorized into different compounds classes, such as linear, cyclic, branched, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The longer calcination time of the non-noble metal catalyst (15 h) and the use of hydrogen resulted in a high degree of deoxygenation. A higher percentage of hydrocarbons was obtained using an already hydrolyzed macauba pulp oil, with high initial acidity (38% m/m), and 10 bar H2. This feedstock and the innovative process provide low-cost alternatives to produce drop-in biofuels on a large scale. © 2020

AB  - Self-powered glucose biosensor (SPGB) is of great interest due to the advantages including single configuration, good stability and particularly no need of external power sources. Herein, a mediator-free SPGB with high sensitivity and good selectivity is constructed based on a hybrid enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) composed of a glucose oxidase/cobalt phthalocyanine/1-pyrenebutyric acid/buckypaper (GOD/CoPc/PBA/BP) bioanode and a MnO2/PBA/BP capacitive cathode. The efficient electron transfer from GOD to electrodes is achieved successfully through the anode oxidation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), one nature product of glucose oxidation catalyzed by GOD, thus avoiding the potential drawbacks posed by the use of redox mediators. CoPc servers as an efficient catalyst to lower the anode potential required by the reaction of H2O2 to 0.17 V. The MnO2/PBA/BP capacitive cathode is utilized because it can not only provide a high discharge potential and adequate capacitance to match the bioanode well, but also exhibit no potential interference to the anodic reaction. The concentration of glucose can be detected simply by measuring the output of the SPGB and a wide linear detection range from 0.5 to 8 mM has been obtained with high sensitivities of 48.66 and 32.12 μA·cm−2·mM−1 with and without stirring, respectively. The recoveries of glucose in grape juice and human serum are in the range from 99.5% to 101.2% with the relative standard deviation (RSD) less than 8%, indicating the good promise of the SPGB in sensing glucose in real samples.

AB  - Use of biodiesel in diesel engine helps to reduce HC, CO, and smoke emissions due to their enormous oxygen content, whereas NOx emissions formed by Zeldovich mechanism shoot up. Implementation of Bharat Stage (BS) VI by April 2020 in India has created extreme pressure on automobile manufacturers to include after treatment technology in their systems. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR), a NOx control technology, is operated using aqueous urea solution as the reductant. There are several parameters that need to be monitored to enhance the NOx conversion efficiency of SCR retrofit. The uniformity index of ammonia, which determines the conversion efficiency, is greatly influenced by parameters like exhaust gas temperature, injection angle, injector position, mass flow rate, and SCR geometry. This paper considers two types of SCR design, namely SCR with and without mixer design and their impact on NOx reduction. The effect of mass flow rate on urea conversion in SCR design without mixer is 27%, but the impact is reduced greatly in SCR design with mixer with less than 2% variation. The UI resulting from different cases ranges from 0.59 to 0.83. Using Taguchi technique and CFD tool, the impact of parameters on both the SCR designs has been investigated and the optimum SCR design is reported. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The current research work focuses mainly on improving the performance and emission characteristics of nanoparticle-blended mahua oil-fueled diesel engine. This work concentrates on finding the optimum quantity of nanoparticles to be blended with mahua oil so that it can be effectively deployed in compression ignition (CI) engine. A 4-stroke diesel engine with 3.7 kW at 1500 rpm was employed in this research. The two nanoparticles, Al2O3 and TiO2, were used in this experiment to blend with mahua oil. The nanoparticles of different concentrations, such as 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppm, were blended with mahua oil to test the performance. Based on the stability, the optimum blend was chosen. The mahua oil was emulsified in order to further enhance the optimum performance of the nanoparticle-blended mahua oil. The nanoparticles act as a combustion enhancer and aggravate the combustion process. The nanoparticle-blended emulsified mahua oil showed better performance and reduced emissions. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) values of 100 ppm Al2O3 and TiO2 blended emulsified mahua oil (EMO) were 29.2% and 28.4% respectively, while in case of diesel and mahua oil, the values were 31.4% and 23.8% respectively. The smoke value for EMO with 100 ppm Al2O3 and TiO2 was found to have decreased by 61.9% and 59.4% respectively compared with mahua oil. The hydrocarbon (HC) emissions for EMO with 100 ppm Al2O3 and TiO2 were found to have decreased by 37.3% and 32.96% respectively. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this paper, we present a neutral non-enzymatic glucose biofuel cell (GBFC) based on a Pt/Au nano-alloy anode. We synthesize Pt/Au alloy anodes by the electrochemical deposition of a Pt/Au nano-alloy on the surface of a thin polyethylene terephthalate membrane with a uniformly distributed microhemispheric array. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GBFC can generate a maximum power density of 0.32 mW/cm2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.42 V, and a short-circuit current (Isc) density of 2.67 mA/cm2 with 5 mM of glucose in a 0.1-M PBS (pH 7.4) solution while the cathode is being supplied with 7% saturated oxygen. The synergistic effect of the Pt/Au bimetallic alloy is found to improve the performance of the proposed GBFC. The proposed neutral non-enzymatic GBFC shows promising feasibility as an implantable power supply system for the provision of continuous and consistent electricity to a continuous glucose monitoring system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuel is the only novel solution to the increase in the greenhouse effect and bursting energy demand. The catalytic cracking of non-edible vegetable oils, namely castor and mustard was studied to yield gasoline range (C5–C9) hydrocarbons. Hβ (Microporous; pore size &lt;2 nm) and AlMCM-41 (Mesoporous; pore size 2 nm–50 nm) materials with different Si/Al ratios were used as catalysts for cracking purposes. Characterization of these catalysts was done by X-ray diffraction, Surface area analyzer, nitrogen sorption studies, TPD and inductively coupled plasma techniques. Used mustard oil was cracked over AlMCM-41 catalysts in a fixed bed catalytic cracking unit at optimized reaction condition (400 °C, 4.6 h−1) obtained over Hβ. The liquid and gaseous products were analyzed using gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-9A). Among the mesoporous catalysts AlMCM-41 (27) was able to convert 75% of mustard oil into 48% of bioliquid and 30.4% selectivity towards BG. Pongamia, neem, castor, fresh coconut and used coconut oil was also cracked using AlMCM-41 (27) catalyst. The major products of cracking reactions were Castor Bioliquid (CBL) comprising of bio gasoline (BG), bio kerosene (BK) and bio diesel (BD) with less yield of gaseous products. AlMCM-41 converted 98% of castor oil into 85% of CBL and it was tested with ASTM 6751 standard procedures for its calorific value, viscosity and flash point. The sulphur emission from CBL run engine reached lower index. The results exhibited the commercial utility of the CBL in the near future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fuel production from biomass offers a low-carbon strategy to address the global challenge of climate change associated with carbon emission. Novel technique with high carbon- and energy-recovery from biomass has been pursued for decades, but rarely achieved. Here we demonstrate the near zero-waste production of high-quality biofuels from poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), a biofeedstock widely accumulated in microorganisms, under mild temperature (200 °C), with 99% carbon utilization and 91.5% energy recovery. Products are dominated by easy-to-use alkanes, butyrates and butanol. This technique paves the way for green production of biofuels from bioderived feedstocks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, hydrothermal liquefaction of household waste was performed to produce valuable liquid hydrocarbons with aqueous phase as by-product. Photocatalytic reforming of aqueous phase was carried out for hydrogen production. Liquefaction of 15 g waste at temperature of 320 °C and solvent to biomass ratio of 13.33 mL/g produced bio-oil of 32.4 wt% and hydrogen 21 wt% in gas product. Hydrogen production from aqueous phase was studied in presence of various concentrations of activated carbon doped Fe/TiO2 catalyst (0.2–1 wt%). Hydrogen yield was 32 wt% when 0.6 wt% of catalyst was used to reform aqueous phase. To ease of operation in economical manner the reusability study of the catalyst was evaluated and it was found to be active for three consecutive cycles. As outcome of this study, household waste can serve for a whooping amount of hydrogen (53 wt%) production via liquefaction and photocatalytic reforming process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - After press separation of the liquid and solid digestate from an agricultural biogas plant, pyrolysis of solid anaerobic digestate was carried out (i.e., at 500 °C, 1h, and 10 °C/min) to produce biochar (37.6 wt%), bio-oil (33.7 wt%) and syngas (29.3 wt%). The organic phase of bio-oil and syngas exhibited high and low heating values of 28.4 MJ/kg and 12.9 MJ/Nm3, respectively. Then, the synergy of coupling biochar with liquid digestate for agronomic purposes was investigated by leaching experiment and growth plant tests on wheat. Leaching experiments using combination of liquid digestate (170 kg N/ha) and biochar demonstrated that biochar addition increases the cumulative leaching of all nutrients, except nitrate, that have a significant decrease of 82% and 91%, respectively at 50 and 100 t/ha, compared to soil treated only with liquid digestate. The co-application of biochar with liquid digestate on growth wheat plant tests demonstrated that biochar application at 50 t/ha did not exhibit a negative impact on the relative seed germination and improved aerial dry biomass production (up to 27.5%) compared to soil with only liquid digestate addition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In-situ catalytic biomass pyrolysis for syngas production is a competitive technology for the recovery of energy in biomass. However, in conventional in-situ catalytic pyrolysis process, the mode of catalyst introduction makes it difficult to separate the catalyst from the char after pyrolysis, resulting in difficulty in catalyst recycling. We considered that the use of monolithic catalyst which has larger size than the biomass feedstock might solve the problem of the separation difficulty between the catalyst and char. In order to verify the feasibility of this strategy, NiO/γ-Al2O3 was respectively supported on ceramic honeycomb, metal foam, and metal wire mesh to produce three monolithic catalysts with different outer surface areas. Their catalytic performance for cattle manure pyrolysis was tested and the result revealed that compared with the granular NiO/γ-Al2O3, using monolithic catalysts with ceramic honeycomb, metal foam, and metal wire mesh carrier respectively increased the gas production by 37%, 33%, and 11%. The use of monolithic catalyst in in-situ catalytic biomass pyrolysis, not only simplified the separation process of catalyst and char, but also enhanced the catalysis performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Non-noble bimetallic nanoparticles anchored on Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks, bifunctional ReMo@ZNB catalyst, has been demonstrated to promote Kraft lignin depolymerization. In this study, the catalytic activities under different heat treatment conditions are ranked as follows: ReMo@ZNB-700 (Air) &gt; ReMo@ZNB-500 (Air) &gt; ReMo@ZNB-700 (N2). Particularly, bimetallic ReMo nanocatalyst with Re/Mo atomic ratio of 1/3 shows superior performance. Excellent yields of Ethyl acetate soluble products (92.18%) and Petroleum ether extracted biofuels (78%) are obtained at 300℃ and 24 h, and the calorific value is 32.33 MJ/kg. The ReMo@ZNB catalyst exhibits superior recyclability and regeneration after cycle experiment. Structural characterization results reveal that the incorporation of ReMo can engender the transformation of lattice morphology, the strength of hydrogenation and acid adsorption. The possible mechanism is based on the synergism of adsorption coupling and hydrogenation over ReMo@ZNB catalyst. The synergic action initiates potential perspectives for improving lignin hydroconversion. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wood pellets (WP) and chips (WCH) are the most frequently sold products worldwide to produce bioenergy under thermochemical processes. The effects of the bulk density of patula pine (Pinus patula) WP (555.97 kg/m3) and WCH (151.29 kg/m3), and their gasification conditions were studied on the properties of the produced biochars (BCs). The aim of this study was to generate a good-quality gas fuel (producer gas), as well as a BC with properties that would enable it to be used as a solid biofuel instead of being considered as a byproduct or waste. An atmospheric reverse-downdraft gasifier was used, setting the air flow at 0.12 kg/m2/s for the samples of biomasses studied. With regard to the gasification performance, the temperature inside the reactor was found to increase by 70 % for WP, obtaining a higher cold gas efficiency (51.6 %) in comparison with the efficiency achieved for WCH (36.7 %). Concerning the properties of the BCs, the highest gasification temperature allowed to reach a pellet-derived biochar (WP-BC) with a surface area (BET) larger than that one obtained for the chip-derived biochar (WCH-BC), with 367.33 m2/g and 233.56 m2/g, respectively. Furthermore, the WP-BC heating value was found to be 29.25 MJ/kg, while this parameter for the WCH-BC was 28.36 MJ/kg. It is highlighted the low probability of corrosion and ash fusion occurrence within the reactor when using these biofuels (raw and BCs). Additionally, regarding the pyrolysis kinetics of the raw biomasses, WCH showed a higher reactivity with an activation energy (Eα) of 80.84 kJ/mol in comparison with the Eα value obtained for WP (124.38 kJ/mol). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The coconut fatty acid distillate (CFAD) was used as a novel feedstock for biodiesel production in this investigation. Its characterization as fuel in diesel engine was also studied. A maximum biodiesel yield of 92.6% was obtained, when esterification is performed with 10:1 methanol to oil ratio, 2.5% sulphuric acid at 60 °C for 90 min. This is followed by transesterification with optimized parameters of methanol to oil ratio 8:1, 1.5% potassium hydroxide at 60 °C for 90 min. 20%, 40%, 60% and 100% of CFAD biodiesel (CFAB) was added to diesel to form blends CFAB20, CFAB40, CFAB60 and CFAB100. Engine test results showed that the performance of CFAB20 is closer to diesel than the other CFAB blends. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of CFAB20 was found to be 4.7% lesser than diesel. Nitrogen oxide emission is higher for all biodiesel blends due to enhanced combustion characteristics. However, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and smoke were reduced by 50%, 36.6% and 42.9% respectively for CFAB100 when compared to diesel at full load. Thus it is inferred that the CFAD is a potential source for biodiesel production. CFAB20 can be used in diesel engines with acceptable BTE and reduced emissions without any engine modification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Atmospheric pressure plasma-based technique for the decomposition of biofuels allows obtaining high-quality graphene powder in one step, without the use of neither metal catalysts nor specific substrates. Despite the numerous advantages of this technology as compared to others, it is necessary to optimize the process to produce high-quality graphene at industrial scale. In this research, the influence of the ethanol flows in the 2.00 to 4.00 g h−1 range on the production rate and the quality of graphene has been thoroughly assessed, through a deep characterization of the synthetized material by various techniques. The graphene production rate steadily increased for ethanol flows increasing from 2.00 to 3.40 g h−1, presenting a maximum rate of 1.45 and 1.55 mg min−1 for 2.90 and 3.40 g h−1, respectively. Higher ethanol flows lead to a decrease in the production rate, favouring the formation of other carbon-based by-products such as methane and ethylene. High-quality graphene is formed in all plasma conditions, with the lowest number of defects being obtained for an ethanol flow of 2.90 g h−1 together with hydrogen and carbon monoxide as main gaseous by-products. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Present investigation highlighted the capability of microalgae cultivation in sewage wastewater integrated with nanomaterial, addressing wastewater treatment and consequent improvement in lipid for biodiesel application. Herein, the isolated microalga Chlorosarcinopsis sp. MAS04, was cultured in primary treated wastewater (PTWW) and secondary treated wastewater (STWW) incorporated with Zinc Oxide nanoparticles (ZnO- NPs). The characterizations of ZnO-NPs were performed by analytical technique and cytotoxicity assay of microalga against nanoparticles (NPs) was carried out prior to the experiment. The nutrient reduction rate of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Nitrogen (TN), Total Phosphorous (TP), and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) by microalga was found higher in PTWW as compared to the STWW when incorporated with the ZnO-NPs. Maximum biomass of 3.43 g/L and 2.14 g/L along with 1.9 and 1.5 folds increase in cellular lipid was recorded in the presence of PTWW and STWW respectively as compared to control (BG-11). The cellular lipids were converted to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) by the process of transesterification and analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS). The cells developed in PTWW and STWW incorporated with ZnO-NPs were recorded with a higher amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) with controlled polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Biofuel properties were found in accordance with American and European guidelines. The present report suggested that the Chlorosarcinopsis sp. MAS04 -ZnO NPs association is capable of better nutrient removal from sewage wastewater. Therefore, the nano-bio hybrid opens a new paradigm for efficient wastewater treatment and consequent quality biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is an urgent need to develop technologies which enable the conversion of biomass into liquid biofuels to fill the gap between limited fossil fuel supplies and increasing worldwide demand. In order to achieve the EU 2030 vision of at least 15% of the fuels used in the road transportation sector will be biofuels derived from non-food biomass feedstocks, the R&amp;D of clean, inexpensive, highly end-user compatible biofuels from a virtually inexhaustible source of biomass should be pursued to make breakthroughs in cost-effective biomass to liquid biofuels (BTL) technologies. Thus, an innovative, consolidated, and sustainable technology using a hybrid digestion-gasification process integrated with membranes to produce next generation bio-alcohols from different biomass feedstocks was designed. The proposed concept was theoretically estimated to achieve an overall BTL efficiency of 44% and a cost reduction for bioalcohol production of 18.6%. Moreover, this technology can potentially achieve an overall CO2 emission reduction of &gt; 75% for road transport based on the preliminary analysis. © 2020 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising feedstock for sustainable biofuels and bioproducts. Among emerging bioproducts, lactic acid has attracted significant interest because of its growing application in many industries (e.g., packaging, medical, and pharmaceutical). In this study, BioSTEAM- A n open-source platform-was leveraged for the design, simulation, and evaluation (via techno-economic analysis, TEA, and life cycle assessment, LCA) of lignocellulosic lactic acid biorefineries. With a minimum product selling price (MPSP) between 1.38 and 1.91 kg-1 (5th-95th percentiles, baseline at 1.57 kg-1), the biorefinery was capable of producing market-competitive lactic acid (market price between 1.7 and 2.1 kg-1), and its performance could be further enhanced (e.g., MPSP down to 1.09 kg-1, global warming potential of 2.79 kg CO2-eqkg-1, and fossil energy consumption of 31.7 MJkg-1) with advancements in key technological parameters (fermentation yield and separation process conversions) and optimization in process operation. Sensitivity analyses focused on the fermentation unit (across titer, yield, and productivity; neutral vs low-pH fermentation) and feedstock characteristics (carbohydrate content and price) were also included to quantify their impact on the sustainability of the biorefinery. Overall, this research highlights the ability of agile TEA/LCA to screen promising biorefinery designs, prioritize research needs, and establish a road map for the continued development of bioproducts and biofuels. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this study, a highly efficient, heterogeneous magnetic acid catalyst was developed for biofuel production. Two abundant residues found in the eastern Amazon region were used as precursors, namely, red mud and acai seeds. The catalyst was prepared for the impregnation method followed by carbonization and sulfonation. The materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system for elemental mapping, thermogravimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, low temperature N2 adsorption, vibratory sample magnetometry and acid-base titration. The best yield obtained in the esterification reaction was for the acai seed sample and red mud in a 1:1 ratio, carbonized at 400 °C for 3 h and sulfonated at 80 °C for 3 h. This sample presented 88% conversion to methyl oleate under reaction conditions of 5% catalyst loading and a 1:12 oleic acid to methanol molar ratio at 100 °C for 1 h. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst was easily separated from the reaction by a magnet and exhibited good capacity for reuse for at least three reaction cycles. The experiments yielded promising results for obtaining magnetic carbon materials from waste generated in the Amazon region. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, the use of red mud as a magnetic source in the synthesis of sulfonated carbon-based catalysts has not been reported to date. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With huge demand of herbal medicine worldwide, herb residue (HR) treatment is attracting growing attention. This work proposed an integrated energy conversion system to treat and utilize HR, which contained a crushing and drying section to pretreat HR, a gasification section to convert HR into syngas, and a boiling section to produce hot steam for HR drying and herb steaming. A pilot scale plant was established to validate its feasibility. The results showed that HR with particle size below 10 mm and moisture content about 20 wt% was qualified as gasification feedstock. The energy efficiency, syngas heat value, and syngas yield during gasification reached 76.1%, 5.7 MJ/Nm3, and 0.6 Nm3/kgHR, respectively. When treating each kg of HR, 1.0167 kg of wastewater was emitted, which primarily came from HR dehydration and herb steaming. Meanwhile, 0.3292 kg of hot steam with 0.89 MJ of enthalpy would be produced per kg of HR as net energy output. This integrated system fully considered the upstream and downstream adaption of HR gasification technique. Highly efficient disposal and utilization of HR were thus achieved. It is hoped that this work could promisingly enhance the overall efficiency of herbal medicine production industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of biofuels to power engines reduces the emission of certain undesirable exhaust components. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of second-generation biofuels on the composition of exhaust gases from a Perkins 1104D-44TA diesel engine. For comparison purposes, the same tests were conducted with first-generation biofuel and diesel fuel (DF). The second-generation biofuel was babassu butyl esters (BBuE) produced via transesterification using butyl alcohol and a sulphuric acid catalyst. Currently, methyl or ethyl alcohols and basic catalysts are commonly used to produce esters. The first-generation biofuel used in the tests was rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME). The biofuels used in the tests were produced using patented technology and a reactor developed by one of the co-authors of this paper. With the engine powered by BBuE, the concentrations of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons and particulate matter in the exhaust gas were reduced in comparison to the engine powered by either DF or RME. Furthermore, by powering the engine with BBuE, lower concentrations of nitrogen oxides were obtained in comparison to its powering with RME. This is because BBuE contains many short-chain esters that are absent in RME. As a result, an engine powered by a new-generation biofuel emits fewer undesirable exhaust gas components into the atmosphere compared to a first-generation biofuel and diesel oil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, a hierarchically porous metal-metalloporphyrin gel (MMPG) based mimic multienzyme system for colorimetric sensing is reported. The synthesis conditions for gel state Fe-MMPG were systematically investigated and the porous structures were readily controlled by varying the reactant concentrations. Based on Fe-MMPG-5 with appropriate mesopores, glucose oxidase encapsulated in Fe-MMPG-5 (GOx@Fe-MMPG-5) with high loading capacity was achieved. The Fe-MMPG-5 provides not only mesopores for enzyme immobilization but also peroxidase-mimic activity in the GOx@Fe-MMPG-5 composite. This multienzyme system was further used for cascade catalysis and colorimetric sensing of glucose with low limit of detection, excellent selectivity and reusability. In additional, this system could also be applied to other oxidases, such as cholesterol oxidase, with intriguing properties. This study combines the advantages of porous gel materials and natural enzymes, providing potential to construct superior biocatalysts for advanced applications in biosensors, industrial catalysis, analytical equipment, and biofuel cells. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrogenase-catalyzed H2/air biofuel cells have attracted wide attention. However, how to obtain thermostable and highly active hydrogenase remains challenging. Herein, we developed a thermophilic archaea host system to heterologously express a thermostable Pyrococcus furiosus cytoplasmic [NiFe]-hydrogenase I (PfSHI). The recombinant hydrogenase could be easily isolated and then immobilized onto a carbon nanotube-modified carbon felt electrode for further electrochemical characterization. The bioanode was able to work at a wide range of temperatures from 40 °C to 80 °C and no high potential deactivation was observed until 0.3 V at 50 °C. Cyclic voltammograms at elevated temperatures for reverse H2 oxidation performance indicated that an inactive state might be formed and then reversed when scanning to negative position. Also, the power density of a whole cell reached 1.08 mW cm−2 using Pt/C as the cathode with a brilliant open circuit potential reaching 1.2 V. The voltage could retain 90% of its initial value after 33 h discharge at a current of 10 μA. Besides, the bioanode exhibited decent oxygen tolerance both in ambient and elevated temperatures. These results suggest that this recombinant PfSHI can be a good candidate for catalyzing H2/air biofuel cells. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Levulinic acid, one of the top 12 value-added chemicals, can be obtained by the transformation of biomass by acid catalysis. Alkyl levulinate has been widely explored as a precursor for obtaining renewable fuel additives. In this work, the organocatalyst CX4SO3H was employed for the first time as an organocatalyst for levulinic acid esterification reactions. Various parameters, such as the temperature, reaction time, and catalyst load, were investigated. The optimized reaction conditions were a reaction temperature of 80 °C (MWI), a reaction time of 2.5 min, a CX4SO3H catalyst load of 1 mol% and solvent-free conditions. Ten different alcohols were evaluated for the synthesis of alkyl levulinate with high yields (ca. 99%), with the exception of tert-butyl alcohol (13% yield). The levulinic acid esterification reaction, a type of green chemistry reaction, has many advantages such as (i) creation of a new C-O bonds, (ii) water being the sole waste, (iii) 100% carbon economy, (iv) metal- and solvent-free processes, (v) short time and (vi) nontoxic and reusable organocatalysts. These advantages, along with the simple workup procedure, make this efficient protocol a greener alternative to the traditional methods used for the synthesis of levulinate esters to generate biofuels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - An integrated biorefinery approach using spent industrial ginger waste for resource recovery is reported. Valuable products including ginger oil, starch, microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), bio-oil and hydrochar were obtained. Approximately 4 % ginger oil, with a profile similar to commercial ginger oil, can be recovered via Soxhlet or Supercritical CO2 + 10 %EtOH extraction. The oil-free ginger residues were processed using two microwave techniques: starch, MFC and sugar-rich hydrolysates were firstly gained through hydrothermal microwave processing (120–200 °C in water alone), whilst chemical-rich bio-oils and energy-dense hydrochar (20–24.5 MJ kg−1) were obtained via conventional microwave pyrolysis (220–280 °C). The ginger MFC exhibited increased propensity to form microfibrillated cellulose (as evidenced by Transmission Electron Microscopy) with increasing temperature. Nanocrystalline cellulose was produced at the highest processing temperature (200 °C). These changes are commensurate with the leaching and decomposition of the amorphous regions within cellulose. The molecules and materials isolated have further downstream applications and, thus, compared to current low value resolution methods (dumping, burning or animal feed), spent industrial ginger waste is a significant resource for consideration within a biorefinery concept. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental problems associated with the use of fossil fuels and increase in energy demands due to rise in population and rapid industrialisation, are the driving forces for energy. Catalytic conversion of biomass to renewable energies is among the promising approaches to materialize the above. This requires development of robust catalysts to suppress deactivation due to carbon deposition and agglomeration. In this work, surface properties and chemistry such as exsolution of B-site metal catalyst nanoparticles, particle size and distribution, as well as catalyst-support interactions were tailored through the use of alkaline dopants to enhance catalytic behaviour in valorisation of glycerol. The incorporation of alkaline metals into the lattice of an Asite deficient perovskite modified the surface basic properties and morphology with a consequent robust catalyst-support interaction. This resulted in promising catalytic behaviour of the materials where hydrogen selectivity of over 30% and CO selectivity of over 60% were observed. The catalyst ability to reduce fouling of the catalyst surface as a result of carbon deposition during operation was also profound due to the robust catalyst-support interaction occurring at the exsolved nanoparticles due to their socketing and the synergy between the dopant metals in the alloy in perovskite catalyst systems. In particular, one of the designed systems, La0.4Sr0.2Ca0.3Ni0.1Ti0.9O3±δ, displayed almost 100% resistance to carbon deposition. Therefore, lattice rearrangement using exsolution and choice of suitable dopant could be tailored to improve catalytic performance. © 2021 BRTeam. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biochar is a carbon-rich stable substance, defined as charred organic matter, produced during biomass thermochemical decomposition, and its application is currently considered as a mean of enhancing soil productivity, which is an important requirement for increasing crop yields whereas, simultaneously, it improves the quality of contaminated soil and water. However, depending on pedoclimatic conditions, its applicability exhibits negative aspects as well. It can also support biofuel production, therefore helping in reducing the demand for fossil fuels. Biochar is providing ecosystem services such as immobilization and transformation of contaminants and mitigation of climate change by sequestering carbon and reducing the release of greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide and methane. It can further reduce waste as it could be produced from everything that contains biomass thereby assisting in waste management. Due to such wide-ranging applications, this review was conceptualized to emphasize the importance of biochar as an alternative to classic products used for energy, environmental and agricultural purposes. Based on the detailed information on the factors impacting biochar properties, the benefits and limitations of biochar, and the potential application guidelines for growers, this work aimed to help in partial achievement of multiple environmental goals and a practical recommendation to growers although its large-scale application is still controversial. © 2021 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

AB  - Environmental pollution and the depletion of fossil fuels have created a growing interest in the world community for renewable energy. Large-scale production of liquid biofuels is supported by governments. Iran is a developing country that supplies its energy needs from fossil fuels. However, clean energy must be used to prevent environmental pollution and ensure food security. In this study, with a case study of Golestan province as one of the leading provinces in the field of agriculture, the existing capacities in this country have been studied. The results showed that 58,945.95 tons of biodiesel and 527.55 million liters of bioethanol can be produced annually in this province. By creating suitable grounds for the production of this fuel, solving technological problems and the support of the people and the government of this province, it is able to supply 2% of the fuel of the country’s gasoline engines. Also, the produced biodiesel can supply approximately 13% of the province’s diesel. Reports indicate that it has the largest share in the production of liquid biofuels in the agricultural waste sector.

AB  - The production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass includes a pretreatment step to alter the biomass structure and facilitate the enzymatic degradation of the polymers to obtain assimilable compounds. In this study, agave bagasse (AB) was used as a feedstock for obtaining methane, for which AB was pretreated with steam explosion and enzymatically hydrolyzed. The pretreatment conditions corresponded to severity factors (SFs) within a range from 1.65 to 2.89, while enzymatic hydrolysis was performed with enzyme loads of Cellic CTec2 within a range from 0.12 to 3.6 mgprotein g−1AB. The best global yields (including pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis) of total carbohydrates (TCs), glucose (GLU), xylose (XYL), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were 0.7 g TC g−1AB, 0.12 g GLU g−1AB, 0.03 g XYL g−1AB, and 0.20 g O2 g−1AB obtained using 2.4 mgprotein g−1AB of Cellic CTec2 with agave bagasse pretreated with an SF of 2.41. The contribution of pretreatment to the global TC yield ranged from 13 to 34% for the different systems evaluated. The biochemical potential of methane (BMP) of hydrolysates (pretreatment at SF 2.41 and 2.4 mgprotein g−1AB of Cellic CTec2) was 0.284 ± 0.02 in NL CH4 g−1 COD with a COD removal of 78.4 ± 1.3. This BMP value was 40% higher than the BMP obtained in the system without enzymatic hydrolysis, indicating the impact of this step on conversion to biomethane. The results at the BMP level indicated the potential of this residue for biofuel production.

AB  - Economically viable alternatives for utilizing municipal solid waste are still a major challenge for society, especially in less developed countries. A potential pathway is using the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) to produce energy, biofuels, organic fertilizers, and value-added chemical compounds. We evaluated an integrated biorefinery structure for the treatment of used cooking oil, pruning biomass, and organic and food residues to produce biodiesel, biogas, organic compost, 1,3-propanediol, and electrical energy at the campus of the Federal University of Pernambuco, which was considered a case study to represent a small city of Northeastern Brazil. A pilot transesterification plant, a biodigestion unit, and a compost unit were installed to process 3.3 tons daily of OFMSW produced. Additionally, research was carried out to produce 1,3-propanediol on a laboratory scale from residual glycerol. The quality of the biodiesel generated from the used cooking oil met national technical standards and the conversion of residual oil into biodiesel reached 93%. The average biogas production was 0.584 ± 0.176 Nm3 kgVS−1, with an average methane production of 50% generating up to 44 MWh of electricity per year. The organic compost produced met the quality requirements of organic fertilizers, such as maturation and nutrient contents. Glycerol treatment increased the yield of 1,3-propanediol production. Our findings demonstrate that the integrated biorefinery will lead to a reduction of US$ 80,000 in the costs of OFMSW management. More importantly, this approach generates incentives for circular economy initiatives in small municipalities in Brazil and other less developed countries.

AB  - Third-generation biofuels are gaining commercial interest because of the rapid growth rate, high productivity of nutrients, and the carbon dioxide sequestration ability of the feedstock, algae. But the selection of algae, cultivation method, and pretreatment techniques remain challenging. The present work describes the high suitability of brown seaweed as a promising feedstock for the production of bioethanol. Sargassum cinereum is a carbohydrate-rich and fast-growing brown seaweed in all marine environments and abundantly available in Gulf of Mannar, India. Proximate, ultimate, and biochemical analysis has demonstrated the potential carbohydrates in the brown seaweed composition. Preliminary studies on S. cinereum revealed that the H2SO4-assisted hydrolysis had produced more fermentable sugars than the tested. A statistical optimization method with 16 runs was employed to optimize the H2SO4 loading concentration (% w/v), residence time (min), and incubation temperature (°C) for the enhancement of fermentable sugars from the biomass. Optimization results have shown a 133% increase in reducing sugars yield. Furthermore, the obtained sugars were fermented to ethanol at a yield of 0.465 ± 0.024 g ethanol/reducing sugars using Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTCC170. The observed high ethanol yield from seaweed sugars was closer to the theoretical yield based on glucose as a substrate. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The catalyst regenerability in steam reforming is vital for achieving the process maturity and commercialization. This work focused on the regenerability of two catalysts containing Co–Al spinel phase during successive reaction-regeneration cycles of simulated bio-oil steam reforming. The Co/sepiolite and Co/Al2O3 derived spinel catalysts were prepared via a thermal-driven solid phase reaction. The catalyst testing cycles consisted of reaction stages performed at 700 °C and subsequent regeneration treatments, which were divided into a coke combustion at 900 °C and a reduction at 800 °C. The deactivation and reproducible performances of catalysts have been ascertained by characterizing the synthesized, deactivated and regenerated catalysts by XRD, TEM, H2-TPR, XPS, Raman and TGA. The results showed that the low activity of Co/Al2O3 was not recovered by regeneration treatments, but attenuated rapidly in subsequent reaction stages due to the high Co–Al spinel crystallinity and deteriorative reducibility. In Co/SEP, the reforming behavior was not fully recovered by coke combustion, correlating with an incomplete restoration of the original spinel structure and an accumulation of cobalt oxides. The recovery of the initial activity and a preferable durability in subsequent reaction stages was attributed to the alleviation of Co sintering after regeneration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The knowledge of the combustion chemistry of oxygenated fuels is essential for the development of detailed kinetic mechanisms suitable for the combustion processes involving biofuels. Moreover, epoxidized olefins, are increasingly used as chemical intermediates or as bulk chemicals. Nevertheless, a dearth of data for their reactivity in the oxidative environment can be observed in the current literature. This study reports the experimental and the model characterization of the flame structure of propylene oxide at stoichiometric and fuel-rich conditions at atmospheric pressure. To this aim, the species mole fractions in three premixed flames stabilized on a flat-flame burner have been quantitatively measured by using the flame sampling molecular beam mass spectrometry. Three chemical kinetic mechanisms retrieved from the current literature involving propylene oxide chemistry have been validated against the novel experimental data. In general, the predictions appeared to be in satisfactory agreement with measurements except for acetaldehyde and ketene. The rate of production analysis in the flame has shown that the discrepancies observed for these species are related basically to the incorrect ratio between the rates of primary reaction pathways of propylene oxide destruction. © 2020 The Combustion Institute

AB  - The biodiesel production process requires accurate information about its physical properties for monitoring the production process. This work introduced a one-dimensional ternary phononic crystal (1D-TPnC) sensor capable of discriminating and sensing between the acoustic properties of different biodiesel fuels in the ultrasonic range. The sensor structure combines a liquid-filled defect layer into a perfect TPnC. The liquid-filled defect layer restores some of the incident acoustic energy and excites a transmitted resonant dip inside the reflection spectrum. The reflection spectrum of the layered TPnC structure is calculated based on the transfer matrix method (TMM). The simulations showed that the proposed sensor has the feature of being ultra-highly sensitive and selective between the Extra-virgin olive, Tesco sunflower, Methyl Oleate, and Soybean biofuels. The numerical results revealed that Soybean oil has the highest sensitivity (76589 m−1) and Q-factor (267) compared with the other three oils. For Methyl Oleate, the sensitivity and quality factor of the sensor reached the values of about 12680 m−1 and 204, respectively. With increasing the temperature from 30 ∘C to 50 ∘C, the sensitivity increased from 33853Hz/ °C to 36096 Hz/ ∘C for Soybean oil while it decreased from 4064 Hz/ ∘C to 37243 Hz/ ∘C for Methyl Oleate oil. This is because the Soybean oil has a higher speed of sound than Methyl Oleate. The proposed sensor has higher performance than many previously reported PnC sensors. Also, it can be used to determine different types of biodiesel fuels. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The influences of nutritional components affecting lipase production from the new Aspergillus niger using wheat bran as substrate were studied by employing Plackett–Burman and central composite statistical designs. Out of the 11 medium components tested, sucrose, KH2PO4 and MgSO4 at final concentrations of 3.0, 1.0 and 0.5 g/L, respectively, were reported to contribute positively to enzyme production (20.09 ± 0.98 U/g ds). The enzyme was purified through ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. Molecular mass of the purified lipase was 57 kDa as evident on SDS-PAGE. Different methods of immobilization were studied and the highest immobilization yield of 81.7 ± 2.18% was reported with agarose (2%) and the optimum temperature was raised from 45 to 50 °C. Immobilized lipase could retain 80% of its original activity at 60 °C after 1 hr of incubation, and was stable at pH values between neutral and alkaline pH. Lipase-catalyzed transesterification process of fungal oil resulted in a fatty acid methyl ester yield consisting of a high percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (83.6%), making it appropriate to be used as winter-grade biodiesel. The operational stability studies revealed that the immobilized lipase could keep 70% of its total activity after 5 cycles of the transesterification process. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article provides perspectives on the opportunities and challenges of integrating biomass liquefaction plants (pyrolysis, hydro-pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, liquefaction in hydrocarbon solvents, etc.) with intermittent renewables such as wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) to provide energy storage and support the development of biofuel production. A techno-economic model is used to assess the levelized cost of electricity from a plant that integrates solar PV with bio-crude production from pyrolysis and its combustion in an engine. The analysis finds that the LCOE for solar PV and biomass pyrolysis is in the range of 65 to 85 USD/MWh when using woody biomass feedstocks, making the scheme competitive with solar PV and lithium-ion batteries. This article also discusses how the integration of biomass liquefaction with intermittent renewables can aid the development of liquid biofuel value-chains by increasing bio-crude supply and supporting the establishment of biorefineries. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Biodiesel has become a promising alternative biofuel that exhibits problems like high cost of feedstock, poor atomisation due to high viscosity, stability issues, poor flow properties and high NOx emissions as compared to conventional diesel. Alcohols have recently drawn much attention as a low cost biofuel that, exhibit problems like low cetane number and miscibility issues. Addition of fuel additives, for example, diethyl ether (DEE), may be effective to overcome the problems with biodiesel or alcohols. In this work, the influence of DEE on engine performance and emissions were investigated for diesel/biodiesel blends, diesel/butanol blends or diesel/pentanol blends. Fuel blends of biodiesel (B20), butanol (BU20), pentanol (PN20), biodiesel with DEE (B20D10), butanol with DEE (BU20D10) and pentanol with DEE (PN20D10) were prepared. Experiments were conducted on a single cylinder diesel engine for varying load conditions at constant speed. Engine performance and emission characteristics were determined and compared.

AB  - Biodiesel is considered the most convenient biofuel, due to its direct use in existing combustion engines; however, its production is not economically optimal due to processes that utilize costly substrates, require high energy expenditure or achieve low biodiesel yields. We used primary sewage sludge for the production of biodiesel and compared yields at different temperatures (40, 50 and 60 °C) and with different organic solvents (chloroform, toluene and hexane), acid catalysts (HCl and H2SO4) and catalyst concentrations (3, 5 and 7%). A maximum of 18 wt% biodiesel was obtained using chloroform with 3% H2SO4 at 40 °C. The conversion efficiency of the primary sludge to biodiesel under these conditions was 86.4%. Based on the fatty acid methyl ester composition of the obtained biodiesel and measured fuel properties, it was deduced that fuel from primary sludge is more suitable for areas with warmer climates than ones that reach temperatures close to 0 °C. However, the fuel properties of the produced biodiesel were within the limits of accepted international standards. We conclude that production of biodiesel from primary sewage sludge under optimized conditions reduces the impact of the feedstock on the environment, decreases overall costs and produces fuel with acceptable properties. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Humanity is struggling against a major problem for a proper management of generated municipal solid waste. The collected waste causes natural issues like uncontrollable emission of greenhouse gases and others. Even though, escalation of waste results in minimizing the areas accessible for disposing the waste. Creating awareness in the society to use organic products like biofuels, biofertilizers and biogas is a need of an hour. Biochemical processes such as composting, vermicomposting, anaerobic digestion, and landfilling play important role in valorizing biomass and solid waste for production of biofuels, biosurfactants and biopolymer. This paper covers the details of biomass and solid waste characteristics and its composition. It is also focused to provide updated information about reutilization of biomass for value creation. Technologies and products obtained through bio-routes are discussed in current review paper together with the integrated system of solid waste management. It also covers challenges, innovations and perspectives in this field. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, new results of comparative research on autothermal reforming(ATR) of biofuels (hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel and long- stored biodiesel) over composite RhSC catalysts (0.24 wt.% Rh supported on structured Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-δ-ƞ-Al2O3/FeCrAl carrier) were obtained. The impact of fuel chemical composition on the catalyst performance was discussed. Hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel mainly consisted of heptadecane, other normal alkanes and small amounts of alkenes together with a portion of unreacted fatty acid ethers. RhSC exhibited syngas productivity of about 2.5 m3Lcat−1 h−1 (STP) at complete conversion of hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel without considerable by-products formation, at molar ratios O2/C = 0.54, H2O/C = 3, T =750 °C and GHSV =5000 h−1. The catalyst exhibited stable operation and no coke formation for at least 90 h on stream. Biodiesel after nine years storage, which was used in this study, contained methyl esters of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and a large proportion of polymeric compounds. It was successfully demonstrated that even this aged biodiesel can be converted to synthesis gas over the developed Rh/Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-δ-ƞ-Al2O3/FeCrAl structured catalyst. Further optimization of the catalyst and reaction conditions (higher temperature, lower GHSV, catalyst doping by promoters) is required for reaching efficient reforming of the aged biodiesel. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that biodiesel and hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel, which combine high energy density and renewability, were very attractive biofuels for fuel cell-based power unit applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Low energy density in agricultural or biotechnological raw materials dictates the need for their local processing. Small-scale agricultural products or waste processing plants can`t profitably use technologies common in large-scale petrochemistry, including the complex and expensive process of steam reforming of biogas into syngas for its subsequent conversion to liquid fuel. The work suggests using small-scale sources of inexpensive and easily obtained biogas and other renewable hydrocarbon gases for the production of liquid biofuel by their air conversion in recently developed matrix reformers into low-cost nitrogen-rich syngas, followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in a cascade of sequential reactors. Autothermal matrix reformers are very compact, simple in design, have several times more specific volume capacity than traditional technologies, and allow processing biogas with a high concentration of CO2. The advantages of low-cost conversion of biogas to liquid fuel based on nitrogen- enriched syngas with subsequent Fischer-Tropsch synthesis are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This work aims to improve the synthesis of renewable hydrochar (HC) co-fired with coal to reduce grenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Acetic acid catalyzed hydrothermal carbonization (cHTC) of Chlorella vulgaris microalgae biomass was investigated based on a 33−1 fractional statistical design of the experiment to examine the effects of hydrothermal reaction temperature (T = 180–220 °C), biomass-to-suspension- (BSR = 5–25 wt.%), and catalyst-to-suspension (CSR = 0–10 wt.%) ratios on process performance indicators. Analysis of variance was used to assess the experimental data. The results show that the application of homogeneous catalyst improves the fuel ratio and energy recovery efficiency up to 0.38 and 36.3%. Ex-ante cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment was performed to evaluate the impacts of co-firing ratio (CFR) and hydrochar quality on multi-perspective mid-, and endpoint environmental indicators. The highest decarbonization potential (−1.54 kg CO2,eq kWh−1) is achieved using catalytic hydrochar biofuel produced at 195 °C, 25 wt.% BSR, and 8 wt.% CSR levels. The application of catalytic and autocatalytic hydrochar blends improves the overall environmental impacts and greenhouse gas footprint of solid fuel firing facilitating the transition toward low-carbon emission power generation. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Ni-base catalysts are promising candidate for the hydrogenation of furfural (FAL) to high-value chemicals. However, slow intermediate desorption and low selectivity limit its implementation. Identifying the catalytic performance of each active sites is vital to design hydrogenation catalyst, and tuning the geometrical sites at molecule level in PtNi could lead to the modification of electronic structure, and thus the selectity for the hydrogenation of FAL was modulated. Herein, PtNi hollow nanoframes (PtNi HNFs) with three dimensional (3D) molecular accessibility were synthesized, EDX results suggested that Ni was evenly distributed inside of the hollow nanoframes, whereas Pt was relatively concentrated at the edges. DFT calculation demonstrated that PtNi significant decrease the desorption energy of the intermediates. This strategy could not only enhance the desorption of intermediates to improve the catalytic performance, but also transfer the adsorption mode of FAL on catalyst surface to selective hydrogenation of FAL to FOL or THFA. The PtNi HNFs catalyst afforded excellent catalytic performance for selective hydrogenation of a broad range of biomass-derived platform chemicals under mild conditions, especially of FAL to furfuryl alcohol (FOL), in quantitative FOL yields (99%) with a high TOF of 2.56 h−1. It is found that the superior performance of PtNi HNFs is attributed to its 3D hierarchical structure and synergistic electronic effects between Pt and Ni. Besides, the kinetic study demonstrated that the activation energy for hydrogenation of FAL was as low as 54.95 kJ mol−1. © 2021 Science Press

AB  - In the present research, biodiesels were prepared from Mahua and Jatropha oil by two-step transesterification. The physicochemical characteristics (viz. density, acid value, iodine value, kinematic viscosity, cloud-pour point, fire-flash point) of prepared biodiesels were evaluated. Finally, the prepared biodiesels were blended with mineral diesel in different proportion and physicochemical characteristics of blended dual biofuel sample blends were also evaluated in order to determine the best blend. The results revealed that the dual biofuel samples met the requirements of EN-14214 (Europe standards), ASTM D-6751 (USA standards) and IS-15607 (India standards). A set of regression equations were also formulated, this mathematical model revealed that different physicochemical properties had high values of the regression coefficient (R2) up to 0.986 for various proportions of blend samples. The obtained results have shown that the pre-treatment process can effectively reduce the free fatty acid value to less than 1% for biodiesels. Further, the values of density and kinematic viscosity were found to be better for sample blends B10, B20, and B30, while B40 was on the upper-end limit and B50 was found to be out of limit range. Furthermore, it was concluded that the sample blends B30 (with 15% blending of each biodiesel) and B40 (with 20% blending of each biodiesel) had better properties and can be used further to test their fuel combustion characteristics on a diesel engine. © 2020 King Saud University

AB  - In this report, we demonstrate the advantages of the dual-mode operation of an enzymatic biosupercapacitor with nanostructured polypyrrole/nanocellulose, gold nanoparticle-based paper electrodes, sucrose as the anode fuel and molecular oxygen as the oxidant. The device allowed conversion of the sucrose biofuel, and offered storage of the generated power in the same, small-scale device. The external and internal biosupercapacitor re-charging modes were compared. The specific capacitance of the device was 1.8 F cm−2 at a discharge current density of 1 mA cm−2. The cell used in the charge/discharge mode of operation allowed retention of 49% of the initial capacitance after eight days of exhaustive discharging under external load. The discontinuous capacitive mode, preserved the biocatalysts activity for much longer time. The use of such enzyme-based electrical energy sources in the capacitive mode i.e. under discontinuous charging was demonstrated as a solution for preserving high specific capacitance and long-term operational stability. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Aflatoxins (AFs) are the extremely hazardous metabolites (carcinogens) that are sporadically observed in crops, and these toxic chemicals are indeed lethal to the health of living organisms including human beings. Thus, AF contaminated food waste needs to be disposed as an environmentally benign way, not releasing it into the environment. This study offered a sustainable disposal and valorization platform for AF contaminated food. Peanut was used as a model food waste, because AF is readily appeared in the peanut during its harvesting, cultivation, storage, transportation process. As the valorization platform, non-catalytic transesterification of AF contaminated peanut was employed to convert it to biodiesel (BD). From the process, lipid in AF contaminated peanut is converted into BD (95.2 wt% yield) at 365°C for 1 min. Since the boiling points of BD and AF are significantly different, this process could also resolve the separation problem of AF (180 °C) from BD (≥ 330 °C) during the transesterification reaction. As a comparison study, alkali-catalyzed reaction was done. The alkali-catalyzed one required a pretreatment process to extract peanut oil for transesterification. The highest yield was 67.8 wt% yield after 6 h of reaction at 65 °C. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Partial hydrogenation of soybean oil-derived fatty acid methyl esters was studied using MCM-41 mesoporous silica-supported Pd-Pt bimetallic catalysts with tunable porosity under mild reaction conditions (100 °C, 0.4 MPa H2, 4 h). This process produced partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters (H-FAME) as a new type of high-quality biodiesel fuel enriched in monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (mono-FAME), which is a potential source for formulating high blends of biodiesel fuel with petrodiesel. MCM-41 supports with various structural properties and morphologies were synthesized by self-assembly with different amounts of ammonia solution as a mineralizing agent. Bimetallic Pd-Pt nanoparticles with a Pd/Pt atomic ratio of 4 were stepwise impregnated on three MCM-41 supports, resulting in a series of Pd-Pt/MCM-41 bimetallic catalysts with tunable porosity (0.89–1.79 cm3 g−1), average pore size (3.2–8.5 nm), and particle size (0.12–0.62 μm). The Pd-Pt/MCM-41 catalyst prepared with the least amount of ammonia produced the best partial hydrogenation conversion of polyunsaturated FAME into mono-FAME, ascribed to nano-aggregation resulting in a dual-pore system containing large pores for fast molecular diffusion; a high turnover frequency (1920 h−1), larger k1 rate constant (0.60 gcat−1h−1), and smaller k2 rate constant (0.37 gcat−1h−1) were obtained. Furthermore, this Pd-Pt/MCM-41 catalyst exhibited excellent sulfur resistance in the synthesis of H-FAME, even though the feedstocks contained approximately 5 ppm of sulfur contaminates. These results demonstrate that the sulfur-resistant Pd-Pt/MCM-41 bimetallic catalysts with stable and dual pore system are beneficial for obtaining higher quality BDF to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Adoption of renewable energy sources such as biomass has been increasing worldwide. In this study, fast pyrolysis as an acceptable and viable method to get renewable bio-oil and biochar is used. Different temperatures and N2 flow velocities were used in the fast pyrolysis process to evaluate the pyrolysis yield of biochar and bio-oil. The waste wood and pig manure were utilized to prepare biochar and bio-oil. X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, high-pressure liquid chromatograph, Micro confocal laser Raman spectrometer, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, and dynamic shear rheometer were used to measure the chemical compositions, structure, and pyrolysis yield of biochar and bio-oil. The obtained results indicate that pyrolysis temperature increases the purity of inorganic oxide in biochar and N2 flow velocity promotes the yield of carbon in biochar. The increase of N2 flow velocity would increase the acid property of bio-oil and damage the products yield of bio-oil. It was also observed that biochar could remarkably alter the fundamental performances of petroleum asphalt including penetration, softening point, ductility, viscosity, and complex modulus. The most important is that the upgraded bio-oil can be used to replace partly or fully the petroleum asphalt which is a promising biomass application. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental concerns due to fossil fuel usage has turned the research interest towards biomass and bioenergy field. Renewable biomass such as microalgae provides numerous advantages as they can grow in wastewater; sequester carbon dioxide, economical and eco-friendly. In this study, effect of pretreatment of microalgae (Scenedesmus obliquus) biomass using post-hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater (PHWW) for bio-oil production through hydrothermal liquefaction at a temperature of 300 °C was studied. Results showed liquefaction of pre-treated biomass yielded 48.53% bio-oil whereas 28.35% was resulted from biomass without pretreatment. The analysis of higher heating value of bio-oil showed that pretreated biomass oil has 36.19 MJ.Kg−1 against non-pretreated biomass oil, which has 28.88 MJ.Kg−1. Bio-oil (pretreated biomass) analysis revealed that 60% of compounds are in diesel and gasoline range with 58.09% of energy recovery. Bio-oil was rich in hydrocarbons of C7-C21 range with less oxygenated compounds. Carbon balance showed that an increase of 13% of carbon was sequestered in solid residue obtained from pretreated biomass and about 146% of increase also obtained in bio-oil. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The UK faces unprecedented environmental challenges which require urgent action. The promotion of renewable energy sources is a promising solution to tackle these challenges. Among these, syngas production from biogas via dry reforming of methane shows great potential as a green alternative to meet global environmental goals. The purpose of this work is to estimate the potential of syngas production from biogas in the UK and its profitability. To estimate the syngas production, we present an overview of methane dry reforming to syngas. This analysis reveals that nickel/alumina catalysts are the most popular choice for the mentioned reaction. Afterwards, the potential biogas production in the UK is obtained. Both set of data are subsequently combined to estimate the potential for syngas production from biomass in the UK. A techno-economic analysis is performed to estimate the syngas price to reach profitability. This analysis reveals syngas prices ranging from 1.15 to 1.56 €/m3 to overcome production costs, which is higher than producing syngas from traditional fossil fuels. Further analysis has also been conducted to estimate the production of different utilisation routes for said syngas including biofuel, methanol and electricity. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The phytohormone producing Streptomyces rosealbus MTTC 12,951 (S.R) and green microalga Chlorella vulgaris MSU-AGM 14 (C.V) were cultivated in co-culture system to evaluate exogenous hormonal activity. Biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and their precursors were quantitatively evaluated by employing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The concentration of IAA (0.72 ± 0.02 µg mL−1) was observed to be elevated in co-cultivation system due to symbiotic interaction between Streptomyces and microalgae. In exchange, microalgae produced adequate volume of tryptophan (Trp) to induce IAA biosynthesis. The Trp stress in late exponential phase encouraged lipid accumulation (175 ± 10 mg g−1). The bioflocculation property of microalgae ensures potential and economic viable harvesting process by reducing 148% input energy compared to conventional method. The overall results evidenced that C.V co-cultivation with S.R exhibits promotional behavior and serves as a promising cultivation process for microalgae in terms of cost efficiency and energy conservation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, an amine-coordinated cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)-based anodic catalyst was fabricated by a facile process, to enhance the performance of hydrogen peroxide fuel cells (HPFCs) and enzymatic biofuel cells (EBCs). For this purpose, polyethyleneimine (PEI) was added onto the reduced graphene oxide and CoPc composite (RGO/CoPc) to create abundant NH2 axial ligand groups, for anchoring the Co core within the CoPc. Owing to the PEI addition, the onset potential of the hydrogen peroxide oxidation reaction was shifted by 0.13 V in the negative direction (0.02 V) and the current density was improved by 1.92 times (1.297 mA cm−2), compared to those for RGO/CoPc (0.15 V and 0.676 mA cm−2, respectively), due to the formation of donor–acceptor dyads and the prevention of CoPc from leaching out. The biocatalyst using glucose oxidase (GOx) ([RGO/CoPc]/PEI/GOx) showed a better onset potential and catalytic activity (0.15 V and 318.7 μA cm−2) than comparable structures, as well as significantly improved operational durability and long-term stability. This is also attributed to PEI, which created a favorable microenvironment for the enzyme. The maximum power densities (MPDs) and open-circuit voltages (OCVs) obtained for HPFCs and EBCs using the suggested catalyst were 105.2 ± 1.3 μW cm−2 (0.317 ± 0.003 V) and 25.4 ± 0.9 μW cm−2 (0.283 ± 0.007 V), respectively. This shows that the amine axial ligand effectively improves the performance of the actual driving HPFCs and EBCs. © 2020 Science Press

AB  - Numerous studies explored the possibility and effective strategies for supplementing hydrogen along with fossil or biofuels on internal combustion engines. Hydrogen is also being employed for formulating fuels such as hydrogen compressed natural gas in the gaseous form and hydrogenated biofuels in the liquid form. The present study evaluates (i) hydrogen usage on the fuel formulation and (ii) investigates the engine operation of an automotive turbocharged diesel engine operated with karanja biodiesel blended diesel (B20) as a reference fuel. Existing literature outlines that biodiesel blends possess lower energy content and emit higher nitric oxide (NO) emission than fossil diesel. The present research paper partially hydrogenates karanja biodiesel using an autoclave reactor with a palladium catalyst to increase the saturation levels and mitigate the biodiesel-NO penalty. Besides, the drop in energy release of B20 is compensated through the provision of hydrogen induction along the intake manifold. The hydrogen flow rates to the turbocharged engine are maintained at a fixed energy share of 10%. Both biodiesel and hydrogenated biodiesel were blended on a volume basis (20%) with fossil diesel (80%) and are designated as B20 and HB20, respectively. The test results reveal that HB20 effectively mitigates the biodiesel-NO penalty with a maximum reduction of 29.8% compared to B20. Further, hydrogen induction yielded a significant improvement (23.7%) in fuel consumption with HB20 relative to B20 without hydrogen addition. The compounding effect of hydrogen usage on the engine operation and fuel formulation exhibited a better performance and emission trade-off at mid load conditions. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - The present work highlights thermal decomposition of acid treated rice husk to produce useful and valuable products using slow pyrolysis process. The sample with higher volatile matter content (57.8%) and reduced metallic contaminants was pyrolyzed and the process was optimised using CCD followed by RSM to achieve maximum bio-oil yield. In order to determine the trend and relationship between the experimental responses and the process variables, mainly temperature (300–600 °C), nitrogen flowrate (0.87–1.5 LPM) and holding time (20–60 min), a quadratic model was developed based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Temperature showed maximum effect, followed by holding time and nitrogen flowrate. Optimum conditions for process were found to be 427 °C, 0.8 LPM and 45 min, which resulted in maximum bio-oil yield of 35.5 wt% with 50.8 wt% biomass conversion. Acid pre-treatment was carried out to remove inorganics, which otherwise would have led to formation of low molecular weight compounds in bio-oil. Optimised bio-oil was further subjected to solvent extraction to improve its quality in terms of low water content (25.8 wt%) and high calorific value (14.56 MJ/kg). The upgraded bio-oil was thoroughly characterised and found to be a complex mixture of acids, phenols, aromatics, esters and other substances. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pretreatment of renewable lignocellulosic biomass is essential to produce fermentable sugars and biofuels in a sustainable biorefinery. However, lignin repolymerization during pretreatment was reported to intensify lignin inhibition in the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose. Seeking green additives to mitigate lignin inhibition is of great significance for sustainable lignocellulosic biorefinery. In this work, green additives, mannitol and syringic acid, were thoroughly evaluated for improving the dilute acid pretreatment efficacy of hardwood. The results showed that these additives used in dilute acid pretreatment altered the structure and physicochemical properties of lignin, thus mitigating lignin inhibition on cellulose hydrolysis. In detail,31P NMR results showed evidently higher aliphatic OH groups of lignin after mannitol addition. The 2D HSQC NMR analysis exhibited more β-O-4 and fewer β-β structures, while GPC analysis showed a lower molecular weight of lignin. Results indicated that mannitol was incorporated into the lignin structure to form etherified lignin with plenty of hydroxyl tails, which suppressed lignin repolymerization. As a result, the surface barrier effect of lignin was largely diminished by mannitol addition, leading to improved ease of cellulose hydrolysis by up to 53%. As far as we know, mannitol as an additive in biomass pretreatment has not been reported. This work presented novel green additives to suppress lignin repolymerization for boosting enzymatic saccharification of cellulose in a sustainable lignocellulosic biorefinery. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - The slow pyrolysis of milk thistle (Silybum marianum L.) seeds (MTS) in a lab-scale batch reactor to investigate the influence of heating rate, temperature, contact period, and particle size on the yields of bio-oil (BO) and bio-char (BC) was presented for the first time. The maximum yield of BO (49.55 ± 2.50 %) was obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 475 °C for 60 min using a 0.25 mm MTS particle size at 20 °C/min heating rate. The chemical composition of BO from MTS was identified by FTIR, 1H NMR, and GC–MS techniques. Following the FTIR outcomes, aldehydes, alcohols, phenols, acids, and alkanes are present in the BO. Also, results from 1H NMR spectrum indicated that the percentage of the aliphatic compounds in the as-synthesized BO was greater than that of the aromatic compounds. The GC–MS analysis exhibited that the MTS derived BO is rich in higher acids (38.64 %), higher esters (21.30 %), and hydrocarbons (11.39 %). The elemental analysis consequences revealed that the attained BO possessed a higher carbon content and a lower oxygen content than its respective MTS with a chemical formula of CH1.67 N0.025O0.10. Additionally, the BO owned a calorific value of 39.47 MJ/kg, close to that established for petro based liquid fuels and comparable to those of BOsamples declared in the literature. Besides, the physic-chemical properties of the MTS derived BO were close to those specified for conventional fossil fuels. Proximate analysis, elemental composition, higher heating value, iodine number, surface area, and morphology of the attained biochar were determined. The ZnCl2 activation method was employed to synthesize activated carbon from the produced BC via the optimized procedure. An impregnation ratio of 1.5:1 ZnCl2:BC, 500 °C, 60 min activation period, and 0.21 mm particle size were the best conditions to yield an activated carbon with 638.66 mg/g iodine number and 677.22 m2/g surface area. The FESEM results affirmed the mesoporosity of the attained activated carbon compared to the macroporosity of the pristineBC. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A terpene-based biorefinery is described that uses crude sulfate turpentine (CST) and gum turpentine (GT) to produce mixtures of p-menthadienes (p-MeDs) as biorenewable terpene feedstocks. An acid catalyzed ring opening reaction (6 m aq. H2SO4, 90 °C) is first used to convert the major bicyclic monoterpenes (α-pinene, β-pinene, and 3-carene) in untreated CST (or GT with 5 mol% Me2S) into mixtures of monocyclic p-MeDs. These unpurified sulfurous p-MeD mixtures (α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, and isoterpinolene) are then used as feedstocks for oxidative aromatization (OA), ozonolysis, Diels–Alder, and hydrogenation reactions to produce p-cymene, fragrances, anti-oxidants, drugs, biopolymers, and biofuels. Mechanistic studies of the OA reaction used to convert the p-MeDs into p-cymene reveal that p-cymene hydroperoxide acts as an initiator to produce polar radical intermediates that are stabilized by DMSO generated in situ through aerobic oxidation of Me2S. This enables CST and GT to be converted into biorenewable p-cymene in 50–60% yields (two steps) using a process that only requires aqueous acid, oxygen, heat, and a final distillation step. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The remarkable journey of progression of mankind has created various impacts in the form of polluted environment, amassed heavy metals and depleting resources. This alarming situation demands sustainable energy resources and approaches to deal with these environmental hazards and power deficit. Pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis address both energy and environmental issues caused by civilization and industrialization. The processes use hazardous waste materials including waste tires, plastic and medical waste, and biomass waste such as livestock waste and agricultural waste as feedstock to produce gas, char and pyrolysis oil for energy production. Usage of hazardous materials as pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis feedstock reduces disposal of harmful substances into environment, reducing occurrence of soil and water pollution, and substituting the non-renewable feedstock, fossil fuels. As compared to combustion, pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis have less emission of air pollutants and act as alternative options to landfill disposal and incineration for hazardous materials and biomass waste. Hence, stabilizing heavy metals and solving the energy and waste management problems. This review discusses the pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of biomass and harmful wastes to strive towards circular economy and eco-friendly, cleaner energy with minimum waste disposal, reducing negative impact on the planet and creating future possibilities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic hydrotreating of algae bio-crude oil from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Nannochloropsis sp. was performed. Different Ni-based catalysts, including Ni/γ-Al2O3, Ni-Cu/γ-Al2O3, Ni-Re/γ-Al2O3, and Ni-Cu-Re/γ-Al2O3, (10%Ni, 5%Cu, 2.5%Re) were used in upgrading of the bio-crude oil. Most catalytic systems could effectively eliminate S and decrease the N and O contents, and enhance more than 20% improvement in the higher heating value (HHV) of the bio-oil (34 to 41–45 MJ/kg). Introducing only Cu could enhance the C[dbnd]O hydrogenation resulting in higher aromatic and alcohol compounds. While the addition of Re is effective for hydrodeoxygenation, it lowers denitrogenation due to amination reaction. Ni-Cu-Re/γ-Al2O3 ternary alloy offered the best results on the overall performance, achieving the highest upgraded bio-oil yield of 58 wt% and the highest energy recovery in the upgrading process (ERupgrade) of 64.6%. As ER in HTL process (ERHTL) was ca. 71.8%, the overall ER (ERoverall) from algae biomass to upgraded bio-oil of 46.4% can be achieved for Ni-Cu-Re/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Carbon efficiency approx. 47.7% can be attained as the carbon in the algae biomass feedstock was retained in the upgraded bio-oil. In addition, reaction pathways for the formation of different hydrotreated products catalyzed by mono-, bi-, and tri- metallic Ni-Cu-Re have been proposed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present investigation, calcium oxide solid nanocatalyst derived from the egg shell and Nannochloropsis salina were used for the production of biodiesel. The morphological characteristics and functional groups of synthesized nanocatalyst was characterized by SEM and FTIR analysis. Process variables optimization for biodiesel production was studied using RSM and ANN. The R2 values for RSM and ANN was found to be 0.8751 and 0.957 which showed that the model was significantly fit with the experimental data. The maximum FAME conversion for the synthesized nanocatalyst CaO was found to be 86.1% under optimum process conditions (nanocatalyst amount: 3% (w/v); oil to methanol ratio 1:6 (v/v); reaction temperature: 60 °C; reaction time 55 min). Concentration of FAME present in biodiesel was identified by GC–MS analysis. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The utilisation of waste biomass in biodiesel production as a sustainable energy source can lead to the incorporation of circular bioeconomy principles in the current economic systems. Herein, we synthesised a magnetically recyclable solid acid catalyst for the esterification of waste date seed oil. The catalysts possessed superparamagnetic behaviour and high saturation magnetisation, allowing them to be easily separated from the reaction mixture using an external magnetic filed. The esterification reaction was modelled and optimised by RSM (Design Expert program) and parametric study. The magnetic solid acid catalyst showed high catalytic performance with 91.4% biodiesel yield with optimum conditions of residence time, catalyst loading and temperature of 47 min, 1.5 wt %, and 55 °C, respectively. The solid catalyst was easily recovered by simple magnetic decantation and reused five consecutive times without significant degradation in its catalytic activity. This approach of using waste date seed coupled with cheap magnetic solid acid catalyst has the potential to create more sustainable and cost-effective catalytic systems for biodiesel production. This will complete the full cycle of waste date seed sustainably and facilitate the development of circular bioeconomy. The LCA results by using CML-IA baseline V3.06 midpoint indicators, for 1000 kg of biodiesel production showed the cumulative abiotic depletion of fossil resources over all the processes as 19037 MJ, global warming potential as 1114 kg CO2 eq, and human health toxicity as 633 kg 1,4-DB eq (kg 1,4 dichlorobenzene equivalent). The highest damage in all categories was observed during catalyst preparation, and reuse, which was also confirmed in endpoint LCA findings performed using ReCiPe 2016 Endpoint (E) V1.04. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Coal fly ash-zinc oxide composite (CFA/ZnO) was developed, characterized and applied as a catalyst in the transesterification of used cooking oil (UCO) with methanol to obtain biodiesel. The prepared supported catalyst was characterized by TGA/DTA, gas sorption, TEM-EDX, FTIR and XRD techniques. Taguchi design approach was used for the optimization of biodiesel synthesis from UCO. Amongst the studied process variables, reaction temperature, reaction time and methanol/oil molar ratio most significantly affected the biodiesel yield and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) content. At the optimum temperature of 140 °C, the time of 3 h, methanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1 and catalyst loading of 0.5 wt%, the biodiesel yield was 83.17%. The FAME content of the biodiesel produced was found to be 98.14 wt%. Moreover, the catalyst regeneration and reusability were studied to verify its stability, and it was established that the CFA-ZnO could be reused for up to four successive cycles with negligible loss in performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The pyrolysis process is one of the most widely practised thermochemical pathways for converting biomass into biofuel. The most challenging aspect of the pyrolysis conversion is modelling the thermal decomposition kinetics of lignocellulosic biomass. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a generic hybrid intelligent model to describe biomass pyrolysis kinetics based on the ultimate analysis (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur content) and process heating rate. First, an analytical model was fitted to the experimental data from thermogravimetric analysis reported in the published literature to determine the pyrolysis kinetic parameters of a wide range of biomass feedstocks. The derived kinetic parameters of biomass pyrolysis (i.e., reaction order, frequency factor, activation energy) were then modelled using three exclusive Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models tuned by genetic algorithm (GA). The capability of the GA-ANFIS approach in modelling the kinetic parameters of biomass was also compared with that of the classical ANFIS model. The obtained results showed that the GA-ANFIS approach outperformed the classical ANFIS model in estimating the pyrolysis kinetic parameters of biomass. Generally, the highly nonlinear and extremely complex kinetic parameters of biomass thermal degradation were satisfactorily estimated using the GA-ANFIS models with a coefficient of determination exceeding 0.940 and a mean absolute error lower than 0.096. The pyrolysis reaction kinetics of five biomass materials, unexploited during the development of the GA-ANFIS models,‏ were estimated with a correlation coefficient higher than 0.811 and a mean absolute error lower than 0.7376 using the generic hybrid intelligent model. The promising agreement between the predicted and experimental kinetic data suggested that the generic hybrid intelligent model could be an alternative to the laborious experimental thermogravimetric measurements, thereby allowing pyrolysis process optimization, monitoring, and controlling to be more effectively conducted. Finally, an easy-to-use software package was developed based on the developed generic hybrid intelligent model to describe the devolatilization behaviour of biomass.‏ © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fossil depletion is facing critical crisis due to its depletion reserves and increased environmental problems. The utilization of petroleum products by the dense population, urbanization of various geographical areas and industrialization has extremely affected the global economy. Fuels of biological origin such as ethanol, vegetable oil and various biomasses are gaining attention It is therefore important to develop alternative fuels in order to protect the global environment and also to focus on long-term supplies of conventional fuels. These biofuels have greater opportunity to promote agro-industrial development and productivity in large scale. Thus, it is necessary to improvise technology and develop resource sustainability focussing into the appropriate policies, production costing, yield, purity and efficiency creating health, wealth and benefit sharing to achieve a sustainable energy in future. The present review article focuses on the recent trends and researches carried out in liquid biofuel production and economy holding its future demand and utilization world-wide. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Crude bio-oils, as sustainable and renewable energy sources generated from thermochemical conversion of forest, agriculture, waste and algae biomass feedstocks, have attracted particular attention to partially and even completely replace the fossil fuels over the past decades. However, due to their undesirable qualities such as high oxygen content, thermal instability, and high corrosivity, further upgrading is required for the direct application of bio-oils for petrol engines or thermal power plants. Various upgrading pathways, including emulsification, hydrotreating, supercritical fluid treatment, and co-processing are being investigated by different international research groups to produce marketable drop-in renewable transportation biofuels. Among them, co-processing bio-oils with petroleum streams in existing refineries is recognized as a more promising solution compared to other conventional upgrading methods because of less capital investment and higher fuel productivity. This work reviewed the up-to-date research activities in bio-oil co-processing including process scale-up, focusing more on the most recent work about pyrolysis oils co-processing in the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) unit and its industrial implementation. The significant knowledge gaps in the co-processing are also outlined for future investigations. © 2020

AB  - The use of diesel-farnesane and sugarcane biodiesel is showing significant potential for reducing harmful emissions from Brazilian road transport. Both biofuels are obtained from sugarcane through synthetic biology that requires fermentation. The present work studies the effect of the sugarcane biofuels, compared to regular diesel fuel, on the performance and emissions of a modern medium-duty diesel engine following the European Steady Cycle (ESC) test procedure. Diesel-farnesane showed the lowest particulate matter (PM) specific emissions. Specific nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from diesel fuel were above the standard limit, while sugarcane biodiesel produced the lowest emissions. All tested fuels produced specific carbon monoxide (CO) emissions below the standard limit, but the biofuels showed higher values than the reference fuel. Sugarcane biodiesel showed an inhibition effect on the oxidation process at the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC), leading to the highest specific CO emissions after the DOC. Specific total hydrocarbons (THC) emissions were well below the standard limits for all tested fuels. Concerning the regulated emissions for diesel engines (g/h), the use of sugarcane biodiesel led to PM and NOx reductions of 32.4% and 37.3%, while diesel-farnesane led to 41.7% and 6.08% reductions, respectively. These notable reductions in harmful emissions support the application of sugarcane biofuels to road transport. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agricultural waste is a good choice to produce biofuels because of its abundance and environmental friendliness. In this work, corn cob and cattle manure were studied by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) in a batch reactor with reaction temperatures from 300 °C to 360 °C alone and in mixtures. HTL products, including bio-oil, aqueous phase, and gas were comparatively analyzed. The maximum bio-oil yields were 22.2% at 300 °C for corn cob and 19.3 % at 360 °C for cattle manure, respectively. Besides, the bio-oil from cattle manure had lower oxygen, higher H/C ratios, and higher HHVs than that from corn cob. N-Heterocycles could be taken as the characteristic compounds of bio-oils from cattle manure, yet organic acids and aldehydes were only detected from corn cob. Although benzenediols and N-heterocycles were major products in water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) for both two feedstocks, the pH values of aqueous phase products are acidic for corn cob and alkali for cattle manure, respectively. This is attributed to the generation of some ammonia from the decomposition of protein in cattle manure pyrolysis. The synergistic effect in mixtures could promote the decomposition of lignin by generating more phenols and benzenediols that improved the quality of bio-oil and increased the yields of WSOM. It could also affect the product of protein decomposition and transfer more N into the aqueous phase. The major component in the gaseous product was all CO2. These results indicate that different compositions could not only react with each other but also change the pH values of the reaction environment and further affect the reaction pathways of other compositions. A predicted primary reaction network of different components from corncob and cattle manure in the HTL was also proposed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Carbon dioxide utilization (CDU) is one of the most critical approaches in climate change control. CDU's future depends on the future demand for carbon-derived products; among them, formic acid is an excellent candidate due to its distinctive characteristics as a hydrogen carrier in liquid form. It is non-toxic that can be used in hydrogen fuel cells, and its significant potential in the heavy oil and biofuel refining process as a hydrogen-carrier substance. This research aims to use Energy, Exergy, Exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental (4E) analysis to evaluate the impact of anolyte material on the efficiency of the electrochemical reduction process to synthesis formic acid (in the term of six new anolyte materials). Results show that the second scenario (IrO2 single circulation mode) is the best option for the power plant. Implementing this CDU system reduces the carbon capture of about 75.20 kg/s or about 89% of the power plant's overall carbon emission. This process's energy penalty can be adequately provided by the PV, which causes greater exergy efficiency and decreases the power plant's energy performance rate. Moreover, the use of IrO2 anolyte is decreased the exergy rate cost and the flow rate cost to the 0.21 $/kWh and 2.280×10-2 $/s. The CDU's investment cost using the DSA/O2 anolyte is 28% decreased compared to the KOH anolyte and reached 7.2 million USD for the CO2 utilization plant. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For the first time, this work investigates the achievability of developing a biorefinery concept around almond hulls by hydrothermal treatment (HTT), thoroughly scrutinising the influence of the temperature (200–300 °C), pressure (100–180 bar), time (20–180 min) and solid loading (5–25 wt%). This process allowed the conversion of almond hulls into four main products: gas (2–13%), bio-oil (2–12%), aqueous (4–69%) and hydro-char (17–89%). The gas consisted of a mix of H2, CO2, CO and CH4 with a LHV fluctuating from 1 to 13 MJ/m3 STP. The bio-oil comprised a mixture of alkanes, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, furans, benzenes and nitrogen compounds with a HHV between 21 and 31 MJ/kg. The solid product resembled an energetic hydro-char material (HHV 21–31 MJ/kg), while the aqueous effluent comprised a mixture of value-added chemicals, including saccharides and small oxygenated compounds. The production of biofuels can be maximised at 256 °C and 100 bar, using a 5 wt% solid loading for 157 min, conditions at which 43% of the original feedstock can be converted into an elevated energy-filled bio-oil (11% yield, 30 MJ/kg), along with a high energetic hydro-char (32% yield, 29 MJ/kg). Regarding value-added chemicals, up to 10% of the almond hulls can be converted into a bio-oil with a high proportion (45%) of phenolic species at 250 °C and 144 bar with a solid loading of 5 wt% for 167 min. In comparison, a sugar-rich (81 C-wt%) solution can be produced in high yield (54%), by treating a 24 wt% suspension at 252 °C and 180 bar for 153 min. Therefore, the versatility, novelty and intrinsic green and holistic nature of this ‘almond-refinery’ concept exemplify a landmark achievement in future energy and chemicals production from biomass, which might help render the complete bio-refinery for almond hulls more cost-effectively and ecologically feasible. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) are typically used in the traditional petroleum refining industry for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) applications. Bio-oils require an upgrading process like catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) to produce advanced biofuels and chemicals. Herein, MoS2/γ-Al2O3promoted by transition metals like nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) was evaluated for the HDO of a bio-oil model compound, 4-propylguaiacol (PG) in a batch reactor at 340 °C under 50 bar H2pressure. The catalyst screening results showed that the sulfided Ni-promoted catalyst gave a high 94% yield of deoxygenated cycloalkanes, however for the sulfided Cu-promoted catalyst, 42% of phenolics remain in the reaction medium after 5 h. The results also revealed that the sulfided Zn and Fe-promoted catalysts gave a final yield of 16% and 19% at full PG conversion, respectively, for deoxygenated aromatics. A kinetic model considering the main side reactions was developed to elucidate the reaction pathway of demethoxylation and dehydroxylation of PG. The developed kinetic model was able to describe the experimental results well with a coefficient of determination of 97% for the Ni-promoted catalyst system. The absence of intermediates like 4-propylcyclohexanone and 4-propylcyclohexanol during the reaction implies that direct deoxygenation (DDO) is the dominant pathway in the deoxygenation of PG employing sulfided catalysts. The current work also demonstrated that the activity of the transition metal promoters sulfides for HDO of PG could be correlated to the yield of deoxygenated products from the hydrotreatment of Kraft lignin. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - The development of an effective biocathode with high catalytic ability and dense biomass is a major challenge for the industrial applications of electromethanogenesis (EM) process. In our previous study, intact anaerobic granular sludge (AnGS) biocathode and EM hybrid system (AnGS-EM) showed superior ability and stability when treating raw biogas, but its maximum CO2-to-CH4 conversion potential and the response to different operating conditions are still unknown. Herein, we optimized the performance of the AnGS-EM system and explored its maximum CH4 production capacity. The AnGS-EM system achieved a maximum methane production rate of 202.15 L CH4/m2catproj/d, which is over 3 times higher than the maximum value reported so far. Within a certain range, the methane production rate increased with the buffer concentration, applied voltage, and bicarbonate concentration. Excessive applied voltage and carbonate concentration not only led to resource waste but also inhibited methanogen performance. The AnGS biocathode could withstand oxygen exposure for 24 h, the acidic (pH of 5.5), and alkaline conditions (pH over 9). Illumina sequencing results showed that hydrogenotrophic methanogen (especially Methanobacterium) were dominant. This work using AnGS as biocathode for CH4 synthesis offers insight into the development of scalable, efficient, and cost-effective biocathode for biofuels and value-added chemicals production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainable reductions in energy and time requirements in fried palm oil (Borassus flabellifer) biodiesel (FPOB) production (97% yield) have been achieved in differently powered reactors viz., low-energy infrared radiation (LEIR) (0.131 kWh) and LEIR with ultrasonic-energy (LEIRUE) (0.12 kWh) in comparison with conventional heating energy (CHE: 0.664 kWh). Life cycle assessment (LCA) employing IMPACT 2002 + indicated adverse environmental impacts of energy-intensive CHE reactor generating 28.4% more respiratory organics, 67.6% augmented global warming and additional 38.3% energy utilization in comparison with the novel LEIRUE reactor. Feasibility of 2-ethylhexyl acetate (2EHA), triacetin (TA), and 5 other esters were assessed as fuel additives (FAs) for FPOB (B100) and diesel-FPOB (B10) in conventional diesel engine. The optimal 1:1 v/v mix of the two best FAs (2EHA + TA) i.e., ETA was blended in 5, 7, and 10 vol% with B10 and B100 for impact assessment. Remarkably, the best 7 vol% ETA blending could successfully diminish pour point and NOx emission by 36 ± 1% and 28 ± 1% respectively for B100. The LCA also confirmed that 7 vol% ETA (for B10 and B100) blending could manage all the impact categories ascertaining environmental sustainability. Thus, ETA can find applications as a potent FA for B100 and B10 blends. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Toxic cyanobacteria growth rates have increased in recent decades due to climate change and human activities. Microalgae, with their ability to produce a large amount of biomass, are considered as a source of energy that can be used to produce biofuels. The aim of this study is to test four different microalgae harvesting methods (sedimentation, coagulation-flocculation, pH variation, and centrifugation) in order to find which is best suited to the A Baxe reservoir, which has been suffering from cyanobacterial blooms in recent years. Centrifugation proved the most efficient method (85.74%–1790 RCF), but it can induce cell rupture. Natural sedimentation and pH variation obtained similar results at 49.36% and 49.02% respectively. Although all four methods have advantages, our results reveal that coagulation-flocculation, using 10 mg/L of Pinus pinaster, results in a removal efficiency of 68.10%, making it the most suitable method, though with 20 mg/L the performance was lower (66.03%). To minimise environmental waste, the microalgae removed were then transformed into pellets to be used as biofuel, with a higher heating value (HHV) of 21,196.96 ± 1602.33 kJ/kg. The pellets obtained from the microalgae residue did not meet all the requirements for use as biofuels, but microalgae biomass could be mixed with other sources and therefore looks like a promising option for the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy and pollution are major issues worldwide, calling for advanced techniques of biofuel production and environmental remediation, such solar photocatalysis. Engineering the co-catalyst at atom level has recently been proposed to increase the photocatalytic efficiency. Here, we report a new strategy for preparing highly stable single-atom photocatalysts containing abundant isolated atomic sites. We used oxygen vacancies (Vos) to confine Pt atoms and to produce single-atom photocatalysts, labeled Pt0.254/black TiO2, that are more efficient and more stable. Results show that Pt atoms are mainly located on surface oxygen vacancies and are rather uniformly distributed on the surface of black TiO2 at a concentration of 0.254 wt %. The single-atom photocatalyst displayed excellent catalytic efficiency and stability for hydrogen generation and phenol decomposition. Overall, our findings propose an alternative method to fabricate and engineer single-atom photocatalysts. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this paper ruthenium exchanged tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) catalysts with different ruthenium loading (RuxTPA (x = 1,2,3)) were studied for conversion of levulinic acid (LA) into gamma-valerolactone (GVL) (a potential fuel/fuel additive). Studies were also conducted on a Ru/C catalyst as Ru/C catalysts have recently been reported to have significant promise for this reaction. Under the conditions used (130 °C, 1.0 MPa H2, 2 h in 1,4 dioxane solvent) one of the prepared catalysts achieved excellent conversion and selectivity to GVL. This catalyst also compared favorably to Ru/C catalysts that have been previously studied in terms of rate of production of GVL per gram Ru. Characterization studies showed that Ru metal surface area and extent of Lewis and Brønsted acidity were characteristics that had a significant influence on the conversion and selectivity of the RuxTPA catalysts studied. The best performing Ru3TPA catalyst was found to be highly recyclable with only a slight decrease in selectivity of GVL (from 100% to 98.3%) being observed after five cycles of testing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the rapid urbanisation happening around the world followed by the massive demand for clean energy resources, green cities play a pivotal role in building a sustainable future for the people. The continuing depletion of natural resources has led to the development of renewable energy with algae as the promising source. The high growth rate of microalgae and their strong bio-fixation ability to convert CO2 into O2 have been gaining attention globally and intensive research has been conducted regarding the microalgae benefits. The focus on potential of microalgae in contributing to the development of green cities is rising. The advantage of microalgae is their ability to gather energy from sunlight and carbon dioxide, followed by transforming the nutrients into biomass and oxygen. This leads to the creation of green cities through algae cultivation as waste and renewable materials can be put to good use. The challenges that arise when using algae and the future prospect in terms of SDGs and economy will also be covered in this review. The future of green cities can be enhanced with the adaptation of algae as the source of renewable plants to create a better outlook of an algae green city. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a thermochemical process that can reduce the environmental burdens of wet, heterogeneous biomasses such as the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). Whilst the effect of processing parameters on hydrochar properties is well known, post-treatments to valorize hydrochars are infrequently investigated. Moreover, more severely carbonized hydrochars have a reactive species present on their surface that may limit hydrochars’ use as a solid fuel or soil amendment/environmental adsorbent. To address these potential limitations, a low-temperature (180 °C) thermal treatment and a chemical extraction (1:4 methanol: dichloromethane) were performed on OFMSW hydrochars. The thermal extraction removed up to 12% of this reactive volatile matter, comprised of alkanes, furans, ketones, and fatty acids. Chemical extraction removed up to 61% of the hydrochar, and the extract comprised mostly fatty acids, suggesting a potential pathway for recovery of fatty acids and condensation of fuel molecules in the solid hydrochar. The higher heating values of the extracts were much greater than the non-extractable solid hydrochar. The non-extractable primary char showed similar oxidative and pyrolytic behavior to a standard bituminous coal. The results indicate that HTC could valorize OFMSW by converting this wet waste into a dry solid fuel, soil amendment or environmental adsorbent while simultaneously extracting valuable biodiesel and biofuel precursors. Given increasing legislative pressure to divert OFMSW from landfills, this new pathway offers an alternative to traditional anaerobic digestion management strategies that produce only methane as a green energy product. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Generating green-based liquid fuels using hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising method for fossil fuel replacement. This study investigates the impact of recycling the aqueous phase in hydrothermal liquefaction processing on fuel yield, quality and energy efficiency using algae as the feedstock. Recycling the aqueous phase in algal hydrothermal liquefaction increased biocrude production yield by 18.9% at 350 °C, although a 12.2% increase in the biocrude nitrogen content was observed. In the second recycling, the nitrogen content increased to 17.6%, which is not environmentally favourable for direct usage in diesel engines due to the possible increase in Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions. Recycling the aqueous phase in Spirulina Platensis feedstock liquefaction led to a 19–30% increase in yields for different recycling numbers, which was influenced by increasing the temperature and by applying catalysts. The heterogeneous catalyst showed a considerable increase (17.8%) in yield, a decrease (9.5%) in nitrogen content, and an improved energy consumption recovery by 30.8% after single recycling. However, a slight increase (2.7%) in nitrogen content was observed after recycling twice. It is vital to reduce the amount of energy used in the hydrothermal liquefaction process to be comparable with conventional fuels. Recycling the aqueous phase reduced the energy usage considerably. Applying the homogeneous catalyst and recycling the aqueous phase twice had the highest energy efficiency (36.8%) and production yield (51.4%) for the hydrothermal liquefaction process. The generated aqueous phase in single and double recycling experiments had up to 77% and 166% more phosphate, which may be of interest for agricultural applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Highly active and selective acetalization catalyst, viz. alanine functionalized MCM-41 (MCM-41-16Alanine), synthesized using post-grafting method is reported. The mesoporous solid is first reacted with (3-chloropropyl)triethoxysilane (CPTES) before alanine is covalently bonded onto the hybrid support as confirmed by TGA/DTG, IR and UV-Raman spectroscopy analyses. Furthermore, the meso-ordered structure of MCM-41 is also retained after surface modification as revealed by the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. The resulting bifunctional catalyst bearing both acidity and basicity exhibits good catalytic performance in the acetalization of glycerol with furfural reaction where 90% conversion with 78% selective to (2-(furan-2-yl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methanol-a valuable dioxolane biofuel additive-are achieved under optimized reaction conditions. Furthermore, the excellent catalytic performance of MCM-41-16Alanine is demonstrated when it is compared to other reported catalysts thanks to its large surface area, acid-base bifunctionality and mesopore confinement that induce synergistic effects. The catalyst also displays high catalyst reusability and no significant deterioration in catalytic activity is shown after six consecutive runs, thus offering a green pathway for synthesizing dioxolane biofuel additive with high selectivity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study presents the valorisation of waste cooking oil (WCO) and marble waste powder (MW) in the synthesis of biodiesel using ultrasonication. The novelty of this study is the development of environmental friendly catalysts from MW for biodiesel synthesis. Performance of five different catalysts such as MW, calcined marble waste powder (MWC), marble waste powder pretreated with acid followed by calcination (MWAC), marble waste powder precalcined followed by acid treatment and calcination (MWCAC) and commercially available CaO were utilized in the synthesis of biodiesel. Characterization of the catalysts was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analyser. The Box-Behnken method was used to design the sets of experiments followed by the optimization of parameters such as oil to alcohol molar ratio, catalyst concentration and temperature using the response surface methodology (RSM). Thereafter biodiesel synthesis was carried out at the optimized conditions in presence of all catalysts along with ultrasonication. Maximum yield of 95.45 and 98.81% was obtained using MWCAC and CaO in 180 min of reaction time at the optimized conditions of oil to alcohol molar ratio of 1:15.9, catalyst concentration of 6.8 wt% of oil and reaction temperature of 64.8 °C. Biodiesel synthesis carried out using conventional stirring method at the optimum conditions provided a maximum yield of 51.92% only in 180 min of reaction time. The present results delivers that ultrasonication reduced the energy requirement by 1.5 folds in biodiesel production as compared to conventional method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of novel algae-derived activated carbon supported NiMo carbide catalysts for upgrading algal biocrude oil by hydrodeoxygenation was investigated. The carbide catalysts were prepared in a two-step process involving sequential impregnation or co-impregnation of NiMo on activated carbon and followed by carbonization through three different methods namely temperature-programmed reaction with 20%CH4-80%H2, carbothermal hydrogen reduction in H2, and carbothermal reduction in N2. The synthesized carbide catalysts were characterized using XRD, BET, TPD-NH3, TGA, and XPS techniques. The catalysts were screened for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of algal biocrude at various process conditions in a stirred tank reactor to produce liquid hydrocarbon fuels. The liquid hydrocarbon product was analyzed by 1HNMR, 13CNMR, Sim-dist, CHNS, and GC–MS to gain insight into algal biofuel properties. The NiMo carbide synthesized through co-impregnation and carbothermal reduction in N2 showed optimal activity for oxygen removal due to its high acidity and specific surface area and a greater amount of Mo2C as active phases on the surface. Response surface methodology was applied for NiMoC catalyst to optimize the effects of temperature (350–450 °C), catalyst loadings (5–15 wt%), and reaction time (1.5–4 h) at a constant pressure of 3 MPa. The upgraded biocrude oil revealed an oxygen reduction percentage of 94% with HHV of 43.9 MJ/kg. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A magnetized zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) impregnated with sodium hydroxide catalyst has been synthesized and tested as a new catalyst for biodiesel production. The new catalyst was investigated for the ethanolysis of vegetable oil to produce biodiesel. The operating conditions of the biodiesel production were optimized using the 2n design method followed by a reduced number of experimental runs. A 70% conversion of oil in the ethanolysis reaction was achieved using the new catalyst. The optimized operating conditions were found to be alcohol to oil molar ratio of 21:1, catalyst loading of 1% wt., a reaction time of 90 min, and temperature of 75 °C. Ethanolysis reaction was found to obey the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. In addition, the Arrhenius pre-exponential constant and activation energy were calculated to be 1.12 × 1010 L mol−1.min−1 and 77.27 kJ/mol, respectively. The physical properties of the product biodiesel matched the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) ranges. Additionally, the product biodiesel achieved a Cetane number of 75, which is 15% higher than the upper range of the ASTM. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The microwave-assisted neat aldol condensation of biomass-derived platform chemical 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) and acetone over hydrotalcite-based catalysts has been studied. High conversions are obtained in very short times with relatively low catalyst loadings. The condensation products, which are biofuel and functional polymer precursors, are selectively obtained. Heterogeneous catalysts with different basic properties derived from the same parent hydrotalcite have been tested. The solids were characterized by PXRD, ICP-AES, ESEM-EDX, TEM, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy, N2 physisorption, CO2 chemisorption and TGA-MS. The products in the final reaction mixtures were determined by GC-FID and -MS, HPLC-DAD and -TOF, and NMR. NMR was also used to determine the stereoconfiguration of the obtained products and pointed to a complete E-selectivity of our process. Different catalyst recycle strategies have been explored, and the most active catalyst, a meixnerite-type solid, can be recycled with low activity loss. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The development of biofuels as an alternative to the use of fossil fuels is growing worldwide due to environmental concerns and energy independence; thus, considerable technical progress has been achieved in biofuel production. Microalgae have been widely used for nutrient removal during wastewater treatment and produce compounds that can be used as feedstock for biofuel synthesis. In this work, the green microalga Coelastrum sp. was cultivated using industrial wastes: molasses as the carbon source and synthetic wastewater as the culture medium to determine the potential of its use for biofuel production. The use of synthetic wastewater (SWW) and molasses improved biomass production when compared with cultures carried out in a standard laboratory culture medium, such as tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP). Growth rates of 0.31 and 1.4 day−1 were attained during exponential growth rate with SWW and molasses and TAP media, respectively. The best results in biomass and lipid content, 2.29 ± 0.05 and 0.71 ± 0.03 g L−1, were obtained after 15 days of culture in SWW with molasses. The analysis of the lipid profile, produced by Coelastrum sp. cultured under these conditions, determined that the microalga can be considered as a high-quality feedstock for producing green diesel, bio-jet fuel, or biodiesel. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and Thermomyces lanuginose lipase (TLL) were co-immobilized on epoxy functionalized silica gel via an isocyanide-based multicomponent reaction. The immobilization process was carried out in water (pH 7) at 25 °C, rapidly (3 h) resulting in high immobilization yields (100%) with a loading of 10 mg enzyme/g support. The immobilized preparations were used to produce biodiesel by transesterification of palm oil. In an optimization study, response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite rotatable design (CCRD) methods were used to study the effect of five independent factors including temperature, methanol to oil ratio, t-butanol concentration and CALB:TLL ratio on the yield of biodiesel production. The optimum combinations for the reaction were CALB:TLL ratio (2.1:1), t-butanol (45 wt%), temperature (47 °C), methanol: oil ratio (2.3). This resulted in a FAME yield of 94%, very close to the predicted value of 98%. © 2020

AB  - Due to looming demand for fossil fuels and environmental concerns over global warming, extensive attention has been given on the development of renewable energy. Biomass materials are used since millennia for meeting myriad human needs including energy and chemicals. In this study, co-pyrolysis characteristics of woody and grass type agricultural wastes, namely Borassus flabellifer and Cymbopogon flexuosus were studied in a fixed bed reactor to evaluate their potential use as source of bio-oil. The effects of operating parameters such as temperature, particle size and heating rate were investigated. In this co-pyrolysis process, the maximum yield of pyrolysis bio-oil 47.10 wt% can been obtained under the pyrolysis temperature of 500ºC, 1.0 mm particle size and at the heating rate of 30 ºC/min. The bio-oil product was analyzed for physical, elemental and chemical composition using Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography (GC). © 2021 Scientific Publishers.

AB  - Biofuels are receiving increased scientific attention, and recently different biofuels have been proposed for spark ignition engines. This paper presents the state of art of using biofuels in spark ignition engines (SIE). Different biofuels, mainly ethanol, methanol, i-butanol-n-butanol, and acetone, are blended together in single dual issues and evaluated as renewables for SIE. The biofuels were compared with each other as well as with the fossil fuel in SIE. Future biofuels for SIE are highlighted. A proposed method to reduce automobile emissions and reformulate the emissions into new fuels is presented and discussed. The benefits and weaknesses of using biofuels in SIE are summarized. The study established that ethanol has several benefits as a biofuel for SIE; it enhanced engine performance and decreased pollutant emissions significantly; however, ethanol showed some drawbacks, which cause problems in cold starting conditions and, additionally, the engine may suffer from a vapor lock situation. Methanol also showed improvements in engine emissions/performance similarly to ethanol, but it is poisonous biofuel and it has some sort of incompatibility with engine materials/systems; its being miscible with water is another disadvantage. The lowest engine performance was displayed by n-butanol and i-butanol biofuels, and they also showed the greatest amount of unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and CO emissions, but the lowest greenhouse effect. Ethanol and methanol introduced the highest engine performance, but they also showed the greatest CO2 emissions. Acetone introduced a moderate engine performance and the best/lowest CO and UHC emissions. Single biofuel blends are also compared with dual ones, and the results showed the benefits of the dual ones. The study concluded that the next generation of biofuels is expected to be dual blended biofuels. Different dual biofuel blends are also compared with each other, and the results showed that the ethanol–methanol (EM) biofuel is superior in comparison with n-butanol–i-butanol (niB) and i-butanol–ethanol (iBE). © 2021 by the author.

AB  - Due to the damaging environmental impacts resulting from direct entry of mineral lubricants into the environment, the use of bio-lubricants as a sustainable and renewable alternative to mineral lubricants is necessary; therefore, bio-based lubricants play an important role in overcoming existing challenges and reducing energy consumption. The present research has been conducted to intensity the production process of TMPTE (trimethylolpropane triester) from rapeseed methyl ester under the influence of ultrasonic irradiation. Ultrasound irradiation is one of the efficient and new methods to intensify the TMPTE production reaction. Ultrasound significantly intensifies the overall process with reduction in energy consumption.

AB  - Lignocellulosic waste has offered a cost-effective and food security-wise substrate for the generation of biofuels and value-added products. Here, whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomic analyses were performed for Serratia sp. AXJ-M. The results showed that strain AXJ-M contained a high proportion of strain-specific genes related to carbohydrate metabolism. Furthermore, the genetic basis of strain AXJ-M for efficient degradation of cellulose was identified. Cellulase activity tests revealed strong cellulose degradation ability and cellulase activities in strain AXJ-M. mRNA expression indicated that GH1, GH3 and GH8 might determine the strain's cellulose degradation ability. The SWISS-MODEL and Ramachandran Plot were used to predict and evaluate the 3D structure, respectively. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS) were used to analyze the cellulose degradation products. Further research is needed to elucidate the cellulose degradation mechanism and to develop industrial applications for lignocellulosic biomass degradation and waste management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Saccharification of sugarcane bagasse is one of the most important process for its conversion to high value biofuels and chemicals. In the present work, a sustainable hydrolysis method combined with catalytic pretreatment by magnetic carbon-based solid acid and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis were applied for the enhanced reducing sugar (xylose and glucose) production from sugarcane bagasse. The pretreatment condition was optimized via response surface methodology with Box-Behnken design. Under optimized conditions (the ratio of sugarcane bagasse, catalyst and water is 1:1:25 (g:g:mL), 170 °C for 10 min), the highest xylose yield of 91.62 % was achieved for 10 min. The enzymatic digestibility of the pretreated sugarcane bagasse under the optimum condition was reached up to 94.26 % at 72 h under the enzyme loading of 20 FPU/g, which is much higher than that of natural sugarcane bagasse. Meanwhile, FTIR, XRD and SEM were used to characterize the effects of the pretreatment process. Overall, this study provides a greener and high-efficiency method for saccharifying sugarcane bagasse to produce reducing sugars. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, sunflower and soybean oil commixture with 50:50 V/V % had been used to produce biodiesel by using a homogeneously catalyzed transesterification. The influence of biodiesel blend, nano blended fuel, and nanoemulsion fuel blends on the combustion, performance, as well as emissions of DI diesel engine, had been examined in the laboratory at various engine loads and a steady speed of 1400 rpm. Volumetric proportions of fuel mixtures: D50B50N000 (50% diesel-50% biodiesel), D50B50N200 (D50B50 + 200 ppm silver thiocyanate AgSCN (SCP1∖), D50B50N200 + 2% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and D50B50N200 + 4%H2O2 were arranged to fuelling a one-cylinder engine. The exhaust emissions of the engine were compared at pure diesel fuel and biodiesel blend D50B50N000, which indicated a reduction in CO, UHC, and NOx emissions upon adding a 200-ppm of silver thiocyanate SCP1∖ as a nano additive. This reduction increased upon adding and increasing the volumetric percentage of H2O2 where the D50B50N200 + 4% H2O2 fuel blend has lower emission values. The results show that CO2 emissions for the investigated fuel blends were elevated than diesel fuel. The presence of nanosized AgSCN and H2O2 enhanced the combustion process because of elevated nanoparticle surface/volume ratio and the occurrence of micro-explosion phenomena of the sprayed fuel particles, which increased the in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate (HRR). A noticeable decrease in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was observed owing to the positive effect of using nano biodiesel blend and nanoemulsion fuels. A consequent increment in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) was indicated for nano biodiesel blend and nanoemulsion biodiesel blend fuels, where D50B50N200 + 4%H2O2 has the highest BTE of 27.16% compared to all tested fuels. Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) values were evaluated and analyzed for all tested fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Utilizing CO2 in an electro-chemical process and synthesizing value-added chemicals are amongst the few viable and scalable pathways in carbon capture and utilization technologies. CO2 electro-reduction is also counted as one of the main options entailing less fossil fuel consumption and as a future electrical energy storage strategy. The current study aims at developing a new electrochemical platform to produce low-carbon e-biofuel through multifunctional electrosynthesis and integrated co-valorisation of biomass feedstocks with captured CO2. In this approach, CO2 is reduced at the cathode to produce drop-in fuels (e.g., methanol) while value-added chemicals (e.g., selective oxidation of alcohols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and amines/amides) are produced at the anode. In this work, a numerical model of a continuous-flow design considering various anodic and cathodic reactions was built to determine the most techno-economically feasible configurations from the aspects of energy efficiency, environment impact and economical values. The reactor design was then optimized via parametric analysis. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Valorization of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels has received considerable attention for decades with tremendous thermochemical pretreatments proposed. However, inconsistencies among studies in lignin removal can often be misleading and even violate the chemical mechanism, which might be attributed to the variation in the filtration method used after pretreatment. A phenomenon, promoting pretreatment strategies based on sugar conversion efficiency or yield only from single and random low-solid enzymatic hydrolysis, was also observed. Herein, the effects of filtration methods using a slow drip metal filter (SDMF) with an aperture of 0.2 mm and Whatman grade 4 filter paper (WGFP) with an aperture of 20-25 μm under vacuum filtration after liquid hot water (LHW), acid, and alkali pretreatments on the chemical composition of the solid and liquid, sugar recoveries, and lignin removal and solid loading (2-15%) on enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover and poplar wood were investigated. Results showed that SDMF increased the glucan content (1.1-3.0%) in pretreated biomass and induced solid loss (3.8-12.6%) into the filtrates, resulting in lower sugar recoveries and overestimated lignin removal compared to WGFP. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and furfural derived from sugar degradation triggered pseudolignin formation, inducing a negative lignin removal for both LHW and acid pretreated biomass. In comparison, alkali pretreatment neutralized the weak acids released from sugar decomposition and achieved a robust delignification (67.8-90.8%). Solid loading used for enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated biomass determined sugar concentration, conversion efficiency, and yield. This result indicates that promoting pretreatment technologies based on sugar conversion efficiency or yield of enzymatic hydrolysis at low solid loading may be misleading. This work demonstrates that the filtration method used for solid and liquid separations after pretreatment and solid loading for enzymatic hydrolysis should be cautiously selected and implemented when valorizing biomass into biofuels. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Enzyme immobilization on solid conducting surfaces faces challenges for practical applications in technologies such as biosensors and biofuel cells. Short-term stability, poor electrochemical performance, and enzyme inhibition are some unsolved issues. Here, we show a simple methodology for bilirubin oxidase (BOD) immobilization on carbon-based gas diffusion electrode for four-electron electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction. BOD is incorporated into a Nafion® matrix and crosslinked with glutaraldehyde by a one-pot reaction in buffered solution, producing a stable BOD-based biogel. The biogel provides stable electrode performance and allows the direct electron-transfer mechanism of multicopper centers buried in the enzyme. A biocatalytic reduction current of −1.52 ± 0.24 mA cm−2 at 0.19 ± 0.06 V was observed under gas diffusion conditions. Additionally, the bioelectrode showed unprecedented long-term stability under continuous operation combined with satisfactory catalytic current without redox mediator. The BOD-based biogel layer thickness and the entrapment of BOD into Nafion network are crucial for the biocathode stability, and BOD crosslinking by glutaraldehyde contributes to enhance the catalytic currents. Further, the BOD-based biogel provides a suitable microenvironment for long-term enzymatic activity involving three-phase interfacial reaction. The present study provides new insights into enzyme immobilization to overcome the critical short-term stability of enzyme-based electrochemical devices for practical applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of new vehicle technologies such as fuel cell hybrid electric and fully electric powertrains for biomass feedstock supply is an unexplored solution to reducing biofuel production cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and health impacts. These technologies have found success in light-duty vehicle applications and are in development for heavy-duty trucks. This study presents the first detailed stochastic techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment of biomass feedstock supply systems with diesel, fuel cell hybrid electric, and fully electric trucks and determines their impacts on biofuel production considering butanol as a representative biofuel. This study finds that fuel cell hybrid electric and fully electric trucks consume less energy relative to the diesel-powered truck regardless of the evaluated circumstances, including payloads of truck (loaded and empty), pavement types (gravel and paved), road conditions (normal and damaged), and road networks (local and highways). The use of fuel cell hybrid and fully electric trucks powered by H2-fuel and renewable sources of electricity, respectively, results in a large reduction in cost and carbon footprint, specifically for a long-distance hauling, and minimize other economic and environmental impacts. While the economic advantage of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle is dependent on the price of H2-fuel and road conditions, use reduces the GHG emissions of biobutanol per 100 km-trucking-distance by 0.98–10.9 gCO2e/MJ. Results show that converting to fully electric truck transport decreases the biobutanol production cost and GHG emissions per 100 km-trucking-distance by 0.4–7.3 cents/L and 0.78 to 9.1 gCO2e/MJ, respectively. This study establishes the foundation for future investigations that will guide the development of economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable biomass feedstock supply system for cellulosic biorefineries or other goods transportation systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Developing biomass-based strategies for liquid bio-fuels production is promising for the reduction of the aftereffects of fossil fuels. The conversion of lignin-derived intermediates such as cyclohexanone is currently of a great deal of interest. The current study aims to evaluate the molybdenum-based hydrotreating catalysts for the conversion of cyclohexanone in the presence of hydrogen. Catalytic experiments at 400 °C, 15 bar, and a range of WHSV were developed. The experiments reveal that catalyst type and reaction WHSV affect the cyclohexanone conversion, product distribution, deoxygenation efficiency, total hydrocarbon production capacity, and heating value of the product blend. The main products include C6 cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenates. Cyclohexane, cyclohexene, benzene, cyclohexanol, and phenol are major products. Small quantities of methylcyclopentane and bicyclic hydrocarbons and oxygenates are also reported in some cases. Increasing WHSV reduced the cyclohexanone conversion. Cyclohexanone conversions up to 89% were observed at the lowest WHSVs over a cobalt-molybdenum sample. The highest hydrocarbon production capacity (99.53%) was managed at WHSV = 5.240 gcyclohexanone/gcat h over a cobalt-molybdenum sample, while the highest deoxygenation efficiency, i.e. 81.29% degree of deoxygenation and 5.35 C/O ratio enhancement were achieved at WHSV = 0.262 gcyclohexanone/gcat h by a nickel-molybdenum sample. The heating values would be enhanced by up to 22.7% when cyclohexanone is converted over the utilized catalysts. The larger heating value (44.90 MJ/kg, 22.7% enhancement) was obtained over a nickel-molybdenum catalyst, which is comparable to the energy density of the conventional fuels. The results reveal that the catalysts are efficient in the conversion of cyclohexanone to liquid bio-fuels.

AB  - Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), a glycerol-derived biofuel (blended with diesel fuel at 20% v/v, Mo·bio®) and biodiesel produced through the esterification of residual free fatty acids from the palm oil industry (pure and blended with diesel fuel at 20% v/v), all of them considered as advanced biofuels as defined in the Directive EU/2018/2001, were tested in a Euro 6 diesel vehicle equipped with ammonia-SCR. Tests were carried out in a chassis dyno at warm (24°C) and cold (−7°C) ambient conditions following the Worldwide harmonized Light-duty vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). The efficiency of the SCR when changing the fuel was also analysed. Regarding vehicle performance, fuel properties were mainly relevant at warm conditions. Because of the lower EGR rate, NOx emissions upstream of the SCR were higher at cold temperature, mainly during the low and the extra-high speed phases of the WLTC. CO and THC emissions were only important at the beginning of the cycle and at −7°C. HVO presented advantages regarding these compounds, while the worse cloud point of biodiesel led to higher emissions. As expected, engine-out NOx emissions were very sensitive to the EGR rate, HVO showing a slightly better behaviour because of its high cetane number. The SCR efficiency was mainly affected by the exhaust gas temperature, although fuel-derived effects were also significant. In fact, a more appropriate NO2/NOx ratio at the catalyst inlet for HVO and a higher hydrocarbon concentration at the low-speed phase for B20 contributed to a lower tail-pipe NOx emissions at −7°C. The oxygen content of biodiesel-based fuels (B100 and B20) led to lower particle number with respect to diesel fuel. Despite its nil aromatic content, the higher EGR rate and the extremely superior autoignition trend of HVO led to higher particle number under high engine load and warm conditions. © IMechE 2021.

AB  - We develop a superstructure framework for the design of biorefineries for ethanol upgrading into advanced biofuels to replace gasoline, jet fuel or diesel. The framework integrates catalysis, process synthesis, and fuel property modelling towards the design of biorefineries producing fuels with specified properties. The proposed framework is applied to identify strategies for the upgrading of ethanol into one or more fuels with specific properties. We discuss the trade-off between profit and biorefinery complexity, as well as the relation among fuel property constraints, the optimal upgrading strategy selected, and process economics. Finally, we show how to find the optimal biorefinery associated with a particular chemistry or catalyst. The results presented constitute the first systematic study of ethanol upgrading considering, simultaneously, fuel and process design. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Gracilaria corticata (GC) macroalgae was studied over a series of nickel–iron-layered double oxides (NiFe-LDO) supported on activated bio-char catalysts at 280 °C and different solvents medium. Maximum bio-oil yield (56.2 wt%) was found with 5%Ga/NiFe-LDO/AC catalyst at 280 °C under ethanol solvent. The catalytic HTL up-gradation decreased the bio-char yield significantly. However the bio-oil quality significantly improved with using the 5%Ga/NiFe-LDO/AC catalyst. Also, improved performance with higher amount of bio-oil and lower amounts of bio-char and gas were achieved, which is due the several reactions happening during the HTL process. Catalytic HTL also revealed that introducing NiFe-LDO nanosheets into the activated char could result in NiFe-LDO/AC catalysts of higher surface area and increased active sites. Being impregnated by 5%Ga, catalysts with improved acid sites and thereby, advanced deoxygenation and aromatization activities were achieved. Hence Ga/NiFe-LDO/AC could be considered as a promising catalyst HTL bio-oil upgrading. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, the kinetic behavior and products of the co-pyrolysis of chili straw (CS) and polypropylene (PP) of distinguishing conditions (blending ratios, addition of catalysts, and microwave pretreatment at different power) had been investigated. Co-pyrolysis effectively reduced the proportion of oxygenated composition in CS, and the Oxygenated composition of 5CS5PP decreased by 76.69% compared to CS. When HZSM-5 was added, the aromatic hydrocarbons in the product increased from 4.46% to 17.34%, and the final residual mass decreased from 12.75% to 7.71%, illustrating that HZSM-5 had a positive effect on co-pyrolysis. Compared with P0HZSM-5, the microwave pretreatment at a higher power level of 567 W reduced the oxygenated composition from 17.41% to 13.09%, and the weight loss peak in the first stage increased from −18.11%/min to −19.94%/min. At the same time, the activation energy decreased from 271.25 kJ/mol to 231.13 kJ/mol. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increase in energy demand, especially in Jordan, has encouraged researchers to consider alternative sources of energy, such as biofuel production from agricultural waste. For this study, Jordanian corn leaf waste was characterized by ultimate and proximate analysis, TGA, FTIR and solid state 13C NMR. The waste showed high volatile matter, high atomic H/C ratio and high O content. The corn leaf waste contained 32.1 wt% cellulose, 18.1 wt% hemicelluloses and 11.9 wt% lignin. The FTIR and 13C NMR spectrums showed high concentrations of aliphatic and carbonyl carbon. The corn leaf waste was pyrolysed in a temperature range of 300–450 °C under a constant flow rate of nitrogen. Higher oil yield was obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C. The gas yield and higher heating value of the product increased as the temperature increased, whereas the water content decreased. The biofuels were rich in carbon and had a high oxygen content, which decreased as the temperature increased. The 1H NMR confirmed the markedly aliphatic character of the biofuel. The GC-MS for the biofuel indicated the presence of hydrocarbon series, large amounts of oxygenated compounds and a few nitrogen and sulfur compounds. The simulated distillation showed a high proportion of diesel fraction (57–73%). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mandarin (Citrus reticulata) seeds were exploited as possible nonedible feedstock for the synthesis of liquid biofuels, namely, biodiesel and bio-oil via alkali–alcoholysis and pyrolysis routes, respectively. The alkali–alcoholysis reaction of mandarin seed oil with an equivalent mixture of methanol–ethanol alcohols was examined and optimized by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The best experimental yield of biodiesel (95.55 ± 1.55 wt.%) was comparable with the predicted yield (95.0 wt.%). Also, analysis by one-way ANOVA showed that the selected variables were statistically significant. The 1H NMR spectroscopy asserted the transformation of the oil to biodiesel. Also, the evaluated properties of the biodiesel were in the range given by ASTM D6751 standards. The mandarin citrus seeds have also subjected to the thermal pyrolysis process in a fixed-bed reactor to obtain bio-oil and bio-char. The influence of the pyrolysis temperature, time, feed particle size, and heating rate on the bio-oil yield was optimized. The highest yield of bio-oil (52.34 ± 1.25 wt.%) was attained at 475°C for 60 min using 70 mesh particle size of the feed with a heating rate of 20°C/min. The bio-oil was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 1H NMR spectroscopy, and ultimate analysis. The bio-oil derived from MCS has an empirical formula of CH1.88 O0.16 N0.012 S0.0005 with 37.96 MJ/kg of heating value. The elevated carbon level, low oxygen content, and high calorific value (25.45 MJ/kg) of the attained bio-char suggest its suitability as a solid fuel. Also, the obtained bio-char can be utilized for preparing carbon adsorbent as a result of its good surface area. © 2020 Curtin University and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Microalgae are potential alternative resources that can replace fossil resources for the production of biofuels and chemicals. Levulinic acid (LA) and formic acid (FA) were produced from defatted Scenedesmus obliquus (a green microalga) via sulfuric acid-catalyzed thermochemical conversion using Box-Behnken design. Following optimization, 39.93% LA and 25.82% FA yields were obtained with 5 wt% biomass concentration and 0.8 M H2SO4 as the catalyst at 180 °C for 40 min. Furthermore, LA and FA yields matched well with a non-linear sigmoidal equation with the combined severity factor (CSF). High LA and FA yields were achieved at a CSF &gt; 10.4. The results demonstrated the potential of microalgae as a biomass and Brönsted acid as a catalyst for producing platform chemicals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer present on Earth in the form of agriculture waste. Hydrolysis of agriculture waste for simple fermentable reducing sugars is the bottleneck in the area of biofuel generation and other value-added products. The present study aims to utilize the camel rumen as a bioreactor for potent cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic bacteria by altering the feed types with varying cellulosic concentrations. A total of 6716 bacterial cultures were subjected to three layers of screening, where plate zymography and chromophoric substrate screening served as primary screening method for cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic potential. The potential isolates were genetically grouped using RAPD, and 51 representative isolates from each group were subjected to molecular identification through 16S rDNA sequencing, followed by quantification of various cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes. Out of 51 potent isolates, 5 isolates had high endoglucanase activity ranging from 0.3 to 0.48 U/ml. The selected five key isolates identified as Pseudomonas, Paenibacillus, Citrobacter, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter were employed for hydrolyzing the various agriculture residues and resulted in approximately 0.4 mg/ml of reducing sugar. Furthermore, the metaculturomics approach was implemented to deduce the total cultured diversity through 16S rRNA amplicon library sequencing. The metaculturomics data revealed the dominance of proteobacteria and unidentified bacterial population in all four feed types, which indicates the possibility of culturing novel cellulose-deconstructing bacteria. Moreover, the presence of diverse hydrolytic enzymes in cultured isolates supports the usage of these bacteria in bio-processing of agriculture waste residues and obtaining the biofuels and other value-added products. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Abstract: In this study, we have investigated the application of the non-precious β-PbO2/MWNTs nanocomposites, which were developed via a simple wet-chemistry procedure, toward electrochemical oxidation of lignin. Structural characterization of the synthesized electrocatalysts was performed through X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and BET surface area analysis. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and chronoamperometry (ChA) measurements were carried out to evaluate and compare the performance of different electrocatalysts toward lignin oxidation. The 33.3 wt% β-PbO2 nanocomposite possessed the highest electro-catalytic activity and stability for depolymerization of lignin. Several oxidation products such as vanillin and methyl salicylate were also identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GS-MS) analysis. The enhanced electrochemical surfaces areas of the low-cost β-PbO2/MWNTs electrocatalyst combined with its good stabilities offer a promising route for developing an energy-efficient lignin depolymerization process.

AB  - Vegetable oils are usually not used directly in diesel engines due to their high viscosity. In this study, biodiesel was produced from flaxseed oil by transesterification at 60 °C. The process variables–methanol concentration (as methanol:oil molar ratio), catalyst concentration (KOH % wt/wt of oil) and reaction time–were used to analyze the process on the basis of methyl ester yield and kinematic viscosity. The reaction with catalyst concentration 1%, reaction time 45 minutes and methanol:oil molar ratio 6:1 had the highest methyl ester yield, of 94%. The kinematic viscosity decreased from 24.2 to 3.54 cSt following the reaction, producing a suitable value within the standard limits. Fuel properties of the flaxseed methyl ester, such as American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity, flash point, calorific value, acid number and carbon residue, were measured and found to be within the standard limits. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Plant-based biofuels are globally accepted renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. Both biodiesel and bioethanol can be derived from various plant-based feedstocks using conventional and advanced conversion technologies. However, the use of conventional first-generation plant feedstocks creates a ‘food versus fuel’ conflict through competition with agriculture for arable land and freshwater resources. In this regard, succulent, latex-yielding species of Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae) have advantages as feedstock for liquid biofuel production. These include high levels of primary productivity, a remarkable ability to grow on marginal lands under xeric conditions, and a relatively small bioenergy freshwater footprint. In addition, yields of Euphorbia-based biofuels are relatively high, and the fuel has chemical, physical, and combustive properties that are comparable to or exceed those of fossil fuels. In this review, we summarize the status of biofuel research using Euphorbia feedstock. Harvesting and drying of biomass, extraction, characterization and refinement of biocrude, blending with diesel, fuel properties, effects on engine performance and emissions, and use of spent residues for production of bioethanol and other valuable co-products are discussed. Major challenges and future opportunities associated with Euphorbia-based biofuel development are considered. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Use of abundant indigenous energy crops for biofuel production contributes to enhance the economy and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. This article aims to shed light on two energy crops available in Pakistan; castor (Ricinus communis L.) and cottonseed (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Although castor has excellent oil content (54%), its high viscosity is not acceptable. Therefore, pre-blending with cottonseed oil was proposed. Physical and chemical properties of crude oils, pure biodiesels and binary blends besides fatty acid composition and degree of unsaturation were analyzed. Biodiesels were checked for quality parameters within limits of American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) and European Standards. Improvement in kinematic viscosity and density of castor biodiesel were noticed following this concept. Moreover, the developed empirical formula indicated that an optimized blending ratio of 93.86% cottonseed oil and 6.14% castor oil accomplished biodiesel yield of 91.12%, kinematic viscosity of 6 mm2/s and cetane number of 48.79, respectively, which all satisfy ASTM D6751. This technique also indicated that pre-blending can raise the ester content of castor biodiesel. In conclusion, it is recommended to adopt the concept of pre-blending to improve the quality of biodiesel and thus the engine and emission performance in compression ignition engines. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The increasing energy demand of a rapidly growing population has rekindled the interest of humankind in the use of biomass as a source of energy. The main factors behind this resurgent interest in biofuels are the fast-depleting fossil fuel reservoirs and concerns regarding climate change. The proper choice of technology for conversion of biomass into clean-burning fuel is essential for sustained use of biomass as a source of energy. Various thermo-chemical conversion processes such as combustion, hydrogenation, liquefaction, gasification and pyrolysis have been utilized to extract various energy products from biomass. Even though pyrolysis, of all the thermo-chemical processes, is still in a preliminary stage of development, it has received special attention in our present energy scenario as it can convert biomass into various liquid, solid and gaseous products. The use of solar energy provides a renewable source for pyrolysis, which gives it an edge over use of thermal energy. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the various pyrolysis techniques and their comparative advantages and disadvantages in terms of their environmental impacts. The advantages of using solar thermal power over other pyrolysis methods are also covered in detail. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The present study defines a novel green method for the synthesis of the nickel oxide nanocatalyst by using an aqueous latex extract of the Ficus elastic. The catalyst was examined for the conversion of novel Brachychiton populneus seed oil (BPSO) into biodiesel. The Brachychiton populneus seeds have a higher oil content (41 wt%) and free fatty acid value (3.8 mg KOH/g). The synthesised green nanocatalyst was examined by the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-Ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The obtained results show that the synthesised green nanocatalyst was 22–26 nm in diameter and spherical-cubic in shape with a higher rate of catalytic efficiency. It was utilised further for the conversion of BPSO into biofuel. Due to the high free fatty acid value, the biodiesel was synthesised by the two-step process, i.e., pretreatment of the BPSO by means of acid esterification and then followed by the transesterification reaction. The acidic catalyst (H2SO4) was used for the pretreatment of BPSO. The optimum condition for the transesterification of the pretreated BPSO was 1:9 of oil-methanol molar ratio, 2.5 wt % of prepared nanocatalyst concentration and 85 °C of reaction temperature corresponding to the highest biodiesel yield of 97.5 wt%. The synthesised biodiesel was analysed by the FT-IR and GC-MS technique to determine the chemical composition of fatty acid methyl esters. Fuel properties of Brachychiton populneus seed oil biodiesel (BPSOB) were also examined, compared, and it falls in the prescribed range of ASTM standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current research work focuses on the conventional bio-catalysed synthesis of amyl levulinate with immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B in the absence of a toxic solvent. The green catalyst and solvent free system offered considerable benefits like mild and gentle condition requirement, lesser-energy demand, easy down-streaming and reusability of the biocatalyst. The process parameters were examined, and the maximum conversion (73.2 %) was obtained under the optimum condition of 50℃ temperature, 1:3 M ratio of levulinic acid to amyl alcohol using 0.8 % (w/v) biocatalyst at 250 rpm speed. The immobilized lipase was characterized by SEM, BET, XRD, FTIR and amyl levulinate was characterized by FTIR and GC–MS analysis. The enzyme lipase was effectively reused till 5 cycles for the formation of ester. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔH, ΔG, and ΔS) and energy of activation (Ea) were determined for the assessment of energy requirement. The activation energy was determined to be 48.42 kJ/mol. The research protocol strikes the development of biocatalytic synthetic route of amyl levulinate without using any toxic solvent, which may contribute to green chemistry approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A comparative catalytic activity study of Pt-MoOx/ZrO2 and Pt-WOx/ZrO2 for deoxygenation of oleic acid (OA) forming fuel-range, linear hydrocarbons is reported. These catalysts (with 4 wt% Pt and 8 wt% Mo or W) were prepared by a sequential wet-impregnation method and characterized for the structural and electronic properties. Pt-MoOx/ZrO2 showed higher catalytic activity than Pt-WOx/ZrO2. Hydrodeoxygenation was the selective pathway over these bifunctional catalysts yielding n-octadecane. High conversion of OA was achieved at 200 °C itself. On the contrary, monometallic Pt/ZrO2 was weakly active. It was selective mainly toward decarboxylation/decarbonylation producing n-heptadecane. Higher amounts of Pt and metal oxide in reduced forms are responsible for the high hydrodeoxygenation activity and selectivity of these reusable, bimetallic catalysts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The recurring inundation of beaches in the tropical North Atlantic by pelagic Sargassum and the associated social, ecological and economic challenges, have aroused great interest in its potential use as a marine energy crop. However, to date, the seasonal availability and low experimental methane potential of these invasive brown seaweeds have hindered their commercial exploitation as feedstock for sustainable energy production. This novel study evaluated Caribbean pelagic Sargassum and the synergistic interactions of hydrothermal pretreatment and co-digestion with food waste at different mixture ratios, on biogas production enhancement and bio-fertiliser recovery. Batch testing revealed that hydrothermal pretreatment promoted the hydrolysis of organics in pelagic Sargassum and food waste, thus increasing methane recovery from mono-substrate digestion by 212.57% and 10.16%, respectively, in comparison to the untreated samples. Co-digestion of pelagic Sargassum and food waste redistributed metal elements and raised the buffering capacity of the digester, facilitating high organic loadings without pH control. Food waste also provided lipids to the seaweed feed which augmented the digestion performance. The maximum cumulative methane yield of 292.18 ± 8.70 mL/gVS was obtained from a blend of co-pretreated pelagic Sargassum and food waste at the weight ratio 25:75. Screening of the whole digestate from co-digestion indicated bio-fertiliser potential. However, the solid fraction necessitates arsenic remediation to meet international soil standard guidelines. The findings of this study are promising and suggest opportunity for the design, scale up and optimisation of biogas systems, equipped with hydrothermal pretreatment for utilisation of Sargassum seaweeds during influx. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present experimental investigation is conducted to examine the working characteristics of compression ignition (CI) engine using oxygenated additives such as diethyl ether and ethanol to the blends of Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel. Experiments are conducted on a water-cooled single-cylinder constant speed DI (direct injection) diesel engine under same operating circumstances. The results indicates that an enhancement of brake thermal efficiency is up to 3.7% and 6.2% with an addition of ethanol and DEE additive in biodiesel blended fuels respectively at maximum load condition. This is attributable to the existence of higher oxygen value and volatile nature of the additives. The combustion characteristics like in-cylinder pressure and net heat release rate of DEE blended fuels are 1.1–5.2% and 0.4–2.7% higher than other blends respectively. This is mainly due to higher cetane number and high volatile nature of DEE. This also results in higher NOX emissions. But 2–9% drop in nitrous oxide emission is noticed for biodiesel with ethanol blends compared to all other blends. This is as a result of superior latent heat of vaporization and lesser cetane number of ethanol which results in lower cylinder pressure about 0.4–2.6% and this end up with more unburned HC and CO emissions. Energy and exergy studies help to analyze the result of ethanol and DEE additive along with blends of biodiesel. The exergy efficiencies of DEE blended fuels enhance up to 2.3–6% compared to other blends at all load conditions. This is attributable to the superior combustion characteristics of DEE.

AB  - Producing syngas and hydrogen from biofuels is a promising technology in the modern energy. In this work results of authors’ research aimed at design of supported membranes for oxygen and hydrogen separation are reviewed. Nanocomposites were deposited as thin layers on Ni–Al foam substrates. Oxygen separation membranes were tested in CH4 selective oxidation/oxi-dry reforming. The hydrogen separation membranes were tested in C2H5OH steam reforming. High oxygen/hydrogen fluxes were demonstrated. For oxygen separation membranes syngas yield and methane conversion increase with temperature and contact time. For reactor with hydrogen separation membrane a good performance in ethanol steam reforming was obtained. Hydrogen permeation increases with ethanol inlet concentration, then a slight decrease is observed. The results of tests demonstrated the oxygen/hydrogen permeability promising for the practical application, high catalytic performance and a good thermochemical stability. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - According to the regulation announced by International Air Transport Association to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there are many attempts to produce bio-jet fuels from natural oils to replace, at least in part, the fossil fuels. However, bio-jet fuels usually suffer from poor cold flow properties. Hence, this research aimed to convert palm olein to bio-jet fuel range with high content of iso-alkanes via hydroconversion over nickel (Ni)/zeolite-based catalysts. The levels of liquid biofuels classified as bio-gasoline, bio-jet and green diesel, including the selectivity for chemical compositions were evaluated. Under 40 bar initial H2 pressure at 360 °C for 4 h, the use of Ni/NH4-Beta catalysts (Ni content = 10 wt%) provided the maximum iso-/n-alkane ratio at 1.67 with a bio-jet yield of 20.8 wt%. The schematic reaction mechanism for this process was also proposed. The incorporation of platinum (Pt) into the Ni/NH4-Beta catalysts to a Pt/(Pt + Ni) wt ratio of 0.24 increased the bio-jet yield to 28.7 wt% with iso-/n-alkane ratio of 1.02. Differential scanning calorimetry thermograms indicated that the freezing temperature (Tf) of the biofuels decreased with increasing iso-/n-alkane ratio, where the Tf of the liquid biofuels with iso-/n-alkane ratio &gt; 1.00 was not observed. For the biofuels/fossil jet fuel (Jet A-1) blends, the use of biofuels having iso-/n-alkane ratio of 1.67 could be blended with Jet A-1 up to 50/50 (v/v) and the Tf of the blended jet fuel was found at ca. −80 °C, which was lower than the limitation according to ASTM D1655-04a (−47 °C). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, biodiesel production from waste edible oil (WEO) using MnFe2O4/graphene oxide catalyst was investigated. For this purpose, the surface characterization of the catalyst was determined using SEM, EDX/Map, XRD, VSM, BET, TGA-DTG, CO2-TPD and FTIR analyses. The catalyst could be easily removed from the reactant due to its paramagnetic property. The BET analysis showed that the MnFe2O4/GO catalyst has a significant specific surface area, which is suitable for the transesterification reaction. Also, the CO2-TPD analysis showed that the MnFe2O4/GO catalyst has two broad and strong peaks at a temperature range of 800–900 °C, which indicates strong interactions between CO2 and active sites on the catalyst surface. Moreover, the total number of basic sites on the catalyst surface was obtained 3978.6 μmol of CO2/g of the catalyst, which is a significant value. Due to the presence of high free fatty acids (2.43 wt%) in the WEO, a hydrochloric acid catalyst was used to reduce free fatty acid content before the transesterification process using the MnFe2O4/GO catalyst. The highest biodiesel yield was obtained 96.47%, which was a remarkable value compared to previous works. According to HNMR analysis, a peak was observed at 3.7 ppm, which was attributed to the methoxy group (O–CH3) on the methyl ester, indicating that biodiesel was properly produced. Then, biodiesel was blended with petro-diesel in various proportions (B25–B100) to improve its physical properties. According to the results, the physical characteristics of the biodiesel like flash point, viscosity, cloud point, density and pour point were obtained 176 °C, 5.4 mm2/s, 5 °C, −1 °C, and 882 kg/m3, respectively. Among these properties, the cloud point is not suitable and demonstrates that pure biodiesel can't be used in the engine in cold weather and should be used in combination with diesel. However, other properties were within the standard range. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The fossil fuel issues due to toxic carbon dioxide emissions and climate change have a direct link with the particulate matter that has caused severe threat to the environment. The bio-based products such as biodiesel and bio-compressed natural gas (Bio-CNG) can be less expensive and adaptable. Biofuels are increasingly being used in transportation, heat, and power development requiring the need for renewable sources of energy. This review highlights the use of dreck organic matters from aquatic environment and soil supplies for renewable energy production for human requirements, sustaining a clean and healthy environment. Dreck can be harnessed to manufacture bioenergy that would help to mitigate greenhouse gases and preserve the environment. Methane, hydrogen, ethanol, bioelectricity, algal diesel, and butanol, or other forms of fuels provide a renewable supply of bioenergy, which can be created by the biological systems. The waste-to-energy methodologies (thermal plus biochemical) for energy production via agro-residues are covered. The key focus of this study is the recent advances in the area of 'synchronous waste mitigation with energy development' techniques. This review addresses the significance of organic substances for the production of clean and renewable energy, including alternate solutions for non-renewable fuels. The needs for appropriate and renewable alternatives for fossil fuels are discussed. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Algae pyrolytic bio-oil contains a large quantity of N-containing components (NCCs), which can be processed as valuable chemicals, while the harmful gases can also be released during bio-oil upgrading. However, the characteristics of NCCs in the bio-oil, especially the composition of heavy NCCs (molecular weight ≥200 Da), have not been fully studied due to the limitation of advanced analytical methods. In this study, three kinds of algae rich in lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates were rapidly pyrolyzed (10-25 °C/s) at different temperatures (300-700 °C). The bio-oil was analyzed using a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization, and the characteristics and evolution of nitrogen in heavy components were first obtained. The results indicated that the molecular weight of most heavy NCCs was distributed in the 200-400 Da range. N1-3 compounds account for over 60% in lipid and protein-rich samples, while N0 and N4 components are prominent in carbohydrate-rich samples. As temperature increases, most NCCs become more aromatic and contain less O due to the strong Maillard and deoxygenation reactions. Moreover, the heavier NCCs were promoted to form lighter compounds with more nitrogen atoms through decomposition (mainly denitrogenation and deoxygenation). Finally, some strategies to deal with the NCCs for high-quality bio-oil production were proposed. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this paper, an epoxy-activated cloisite (ECL) was prepared as a new heterofunctional carrier via a reaction between cloisite 30B (CL) and epichlorohydrin and utilized for covalent immobilization of lipase from Candida rugosa. The lipase immobilized on the ECL (LECL) was successfully used in the olive oil hydrolysis, synthesis of isoamyl acetate (banana flavor), and biodiesel production. The TGA, FT-IR, SEM, and XRD were used to characterize CL, ECL, and LECL. The influences of temperature, pH, thermal stability, and storage capacity were examined in the olive oil hydrolysis. The effects of solvent, temperature, time, water content, and substrates molar ratio on the yields of ester and biodiesel were also investigated. In the optimized conditions, the hydrolytic activity of LECL was 1.85 ± 0.05 U/ mg, and the maximum yield of ester and biodiesel was 91.6% and 95.4%, respectively. The LECL showed good thermal stability and storage capacity compared to the free lipase. Additionally, LECL was reusable for both esterification and transesterification after being used for nine cycles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The core objective of this study is to pull back the worsened combustion, emission, and performance characteristics of a CI engine fuelled with waste tire pyrolysis oil - diesel fuel blends. Four fuels are tested in the experiments. These are (1) 100% diesel fuel, (2) 20% waste tire pyrolysis oil + 80% diesel fuel, (3) 10% pyrolysis oil and 80% diesel fuel containing 10% waste biodiesel, and finally, (4) 10% waste tire pyrolysis oil and 80% diesel fuel containing 10% waste fusel oil. The tests are performed at a constant engine speed of 2400 rpm, and varying engine loads from 3 to 12 Nm with intervals of 3 Nm. In the results, it is noticed that using of waste tire pyrolysis oil - diesel fuel blend is reducing the brake thermal efficiency down to 9.13% for waste tire pyrolysis oil - diesel fuel blends, however, this reduction is being pulled back by 7.51%, and 3.82% with the addition of waste biodiesel, and fusel oil, respectively as compared to that of diesel fuel. On the other hand, waste tire pyrolysis oil - diesel fuel blend increased the brake specific fuel consumption by 21.78%, however, this increase is being pulled back by 8.89%, and 12.57% for waste biodiesel, and fusel oil, respectively. The increase in carbon monoxide for waste tire pyrolysis oil-diesel fuel is 7.09% in comparison with that of diesel fuel. However, with the addition of biofuels, carbon monoxide is being dropped by 7.69% for waste biodiesel, and 19.23% for fusel oil due to the high oxygen contents of waste biofuels. Moreover, waste tire pyrolysis oil-diesel fuel blend is increasing nitrogen oxide by 7.09%, but this increase by 4.64% with the addition of waste biodiesel. On the other hand, the addition of fusel oil is converting the increasing trend of nitrogen oxide into a reduction of 3.09% owing to fusel oil's water content. As a consequence, this research is proving that the waste biofuels are able to improve poor combustion, emission, and performance characteristics of binary waste tire pyrolysis oil – diesel blend with the doping of waste biofuels, and suggesting ternary blends rather than waste tire pyrolysis oil alone for diesel engines. Moreover, it is noticed that burning waste products is a very effective tool for both waste management and alternate to fossil fuels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Calcium oxide is one of the most promising heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production. However, an inherent drawback of CaO is the leaching of active species into the reaction solution with the degraded reusability. To strengthen the stability, different supports are composited with the SrO–CaO oxide through the hydrothermal method and mass ratio of SrO to CaO are optimized to get the best outcome of the catalyst. Meanwhile, various characterization methods, including TG, XRD, SEM-EDX, CO2-TPD, XPS, ATR-FTIR and ICP-AES, are used to explore the physicochemical properties of catalysts. The 0.4-SrO-CaO-Al2O3 catalyst shows the best catalytic capability in transesterification of palm oil with methanol to produce biodiesel, where the FAME yield of 98.16% is achieved with the molar ratio of methanol to oil of 18:1 and catalyst concentration of 7.5 wt% at 65 °C for 3 h. Besides, ascribed to the greatly reduced leaching out of the active species, this catalyst presents the satisfying reusability and the FAME yield is slightly decreased to 92.61% for the fifth reused cycle. Therefore, this modification method for SrO–CaO–Al2O3 is feasible for enhancing the catalytic stability in transesterification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The development of efficient and reusable catalysts is desired to improve biodiesel production process. For this purpose, the magnetic Fe3O4/ZIF-8 composites were first prepared by incorporating ZIF-8 MOF into Fe3O4 nanoparticles through in-situ approach, and then a vanadium-substituted heteropolyacid (HPA), H6PV3MoW8O40, was encapsulated in the support to afford the solid catalyst. The so-prepared catalysts were characterized by using XRD, FT-IR, TEM, SEM, TG, VSM, and nitrogen porosimetry measurement. Results revealed that the Fe3O4/ZIF-8 support was really formed, and the HPAs had been loaded on the magnetic composite. The catalytic performances of the developed catalysts were evaluated for the heterogeneous biodiesel production from the low-quantity oils. This catalyst had good magnetic responsiveness, and could catalyze the transesterification of soybean oil and esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) simultaneously, thus achieving one-step transformation of triglycerides and FFAs to biodiesel in a heterogeneous manner. The transesterification conversion obtained was 92.6% with 30:1 methanol/oil molar ratio at a catalyst loading of 6 wt% and reaction temperature of 160 °C for 10 h. Moreover, the solid catalyst could be recycled by an external magnet, and displayed a good reusability with a minimal mass loss and a slight decrease in the activity after reuse for five runs. This protocol showed great potential for sustainable biodiesel production from the low-quantity oils due to the pronounced activity and good reusability of the solid catalyst. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate biodiesel production via transesterification of sunflower oil employing heterogeneous catalyst derived from indigenous ginger (Zingiber Officinale) leaves. It also aims to compare the techno-economy performance of the ginger-based catalysts in 3 different forms viz. calcinated (CGL), activated by KOH (KGL) and NaOH (NGL). The plant-based catalysts were characterised by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The parametric effects on the biodiesel production such as reaction time, methanol to oil ratio and catalyst loading were investigated. The experimental result shows that 1.6 wt % catalyst, 6:1 M ratio of alcohol to oil, 1 h 30 min of reaction time with a speed of 200 rpm gave the best results. It was found that the KGL obtained highest biodiesel yield of 93.83% under optimum conditions. Subsequently, the specific energy and energy productivity of KGL catalyst was found to be 1.2728, 26.1544 MJ/kg and 0.0382 kg/MJ, respectively, per 1 L of biodiesel. Meanwhile, the renewable energy to non-renewable energy ratio for CGL, KGL and NGL is found to be 3.17, 4.01 and 3.67, respectively. A higher sustainable renewable energy-yield ratio and overall economical profit cost ratio are preferable for the biodiesel production process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel, as a green fuel, acts as a potential candidate to supplement conventional fossil fuels. This research study targets green environment (using biodiesel) and clean environment (reduce wastewater) by producing biodiesel through oleaginous biomasses (Yarrowia lipolytica, Metschnikowia pulcherrima and Lipomyces starkeyi) grown on pulp and paper industrial wastewater. Batch culture studies were explored for the potential feedstock of the oleaginous organism by the synthesis of single cell oil and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to design the optimal experimental matrix and identify the optimal process conditions that enhance the FAME yield. To determine the inherent characteristics of the growth of oleaginous biomasses on the industrial wastewater, a data-driven adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is implemented. Y. lipolytica strain cultured shown high biomass concentration of 32.36 g/l with biomass productivity of 5.39 g/l/d was considered for further scale-up for the transesterification process. Results indicated that the maximum yield of 0.48 (g-biodiesel/g-lipid) was obtained under the 2.5 g of lipid dosage with 0.02 g/ml of catalyst concentration by constant stirring at 70 °C. The optimum conditions to achieve maximum FAME yield of 1.154 g/g was obtained at 2.485 g, 70.87 °C and 0.021 g/ml for lipid dosage, temperature and catalyst concentrations, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conversion of high acid value (AV) waste cooking oils (WCOs) into biofuels was studied using the cracking process over spent fluid catalytic cracking (SFCC) catalysts. The processing of WCO was carried out in a fluid catalytic cracking lab-scale unit with temperatures ranging from 450 to 520 °C. From 480 °C, whatever the spent catalysts, WCOs with AV in range of 6–22 mgKOH/g can be converted to liquid fuels with the near zero AV (AV < 0.5 mgKOH/g). The yields of diesel, gasoline, LPG are in range of 25–29 wt%, 40–42 wt% and 14–18 wt%, respectively, while the coke formation is limited at 5–6 wt%. The increase of temperature to 520 °C enhances the conversion of diesel to gasoline and LPG. The presence of ZSM-5 in SFCC catalyst leads to an increase in propylene and LPG yields. Otherwise, higher rare earth content could limit the zeolite destruction, resulting in a better catalytic cracking activity. This study reports a remarkable approach that encourages the simultaneous utilization of multiple hazardous substances, SFCC catalysts and WCOs, as low-cost raw materials for biofuel production. Finally, after biofuel production, the SFCC catalysts can also be reused to produce high purity of a concentrate of La and Ce. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The combustion of biofuel in compression ignition engines produces lower carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions compared to diesel fuel but higher NOx emissions. In view of reducing NOx emission, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) technique was used in the present investigation to study its effect on engine performance and emission characteristics of a twin cylinder off-road vehicle diesel engine (Simpson S217-tractor). The blends of pine oil - soapnut oil methyl ester (P75SNB25), diesel - soapnut oil methyl ester (SNB20) were prepared on volume basis and used in the test engine with a fixed rate of 10% EGR under various loads. The soapnut oil was extracted from the soapnut seeds and trans-esterified in two stages using methanol and catalysts. The high viscosity of soapnut oil methyl ester is compensated by blending it with low viscous pine oil. The experiments were conducted in a four stroke, twin cylinder tractor diesel engine to study the performance and emission characteristics of the prepared biofuel blends. The results showed that the specific fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature and HC emission of the hybrid biofuel blend P75SNB25 with 10% EGR rate decreased by 3.44%, 3.90% and 20% respectively than diesel operation without EGR at full load condition. The increase in brake thermal efficiency and CO emission of about 4.44% and 8% was also observed. For the blend SNB20 with 10% EGR, the reduction in HC, NOx emission and EGT was about 20%, 10.55% and 3.12% respectively at full load than diesel operation without EGR. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bimetallic Ru-Pd catalysts are increasingly being investigated for applications in the upgrading of bio-oils to biofuels, owing to their high catalytic activities. Similarly, the recent development of Ru-Pd alloyed nanoparticle (NP) incorporated into hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts that can be utilized for tuning the selectivity of desired products has also received considerable attention. In the present study, nanoclusters of Ru0-Pd0 that self-assemble into spherical-like Ru-Pd bimetallic catalytic sites were successfully grown on the surfaces of BN nanosheets (Ru-Pd/BN NCs) via microwave irradiation for 30 s. HR-TEM investigations revealed the formation of 25 nm sized Ru-Pd nanoparticles comprising ≤ 2 nm hexagonal closed-pack (hcp) Ru-Pd clusters with Ru crystallites on the BN nanosheets. Further, furfural was effectively converted into furfural alcohol at a lower temperature (150 °C) and valuable cyclopentanone was obtained at a higher temperature (&gt;250 °C) over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst through the protonation of water molecules. Furthermore, various solvents namely 2-propanol, toluene, and cyclohexane were also used to achieve the production of furan and tetrahydrofuran over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst via the decarbonylation of furfural under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, for real-time upgrading, furfural-rich bio-oil produced by the pyrolysis of date-tree biomass was processed over the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst to obtain a maximum of 97% furfural conversion with a 71% FFA yield at 150 °C. The stability and reusability of the catalyst were also determined. The results demonstrated that the Ru-Pd/BN catalyst is highly active and chemically stable, and is therefore suitable for industrial applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae represent a sustainable feedstock for producing biofuels and biomaterials. In this work, levulinic acid (LA) and formic acid (FA) were produced by catalytic hydrothermal conversion of the lipid-extracted residue of Chlorella vulgaris as a renewable bioresource. Following statistical optimization using a Box-Behnken design, yields of 39.27% LA and 22.06% FA were achieved from 5% biomass treated with 0.95 M HCl at 170 °C for 30 min. In conclusion, lipid-extracted microalgal residue and a Brønsted acid catalyst are useful for producing LA and FA. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - The conversion of renewable biomasses into biofuels and chemicals represents a strategic way to reduce the use of fossil feedstock, by contributing in switching to a more sustainable society. The use of agro-industrial wastes does not subtract resources destined for food consumption. In addition, waste utilization would result in a reduction of its accumulation, with a consequent decrease of environmental impact and financial losses due to the relevant disposal. In this context, a wide variety of exploitable agricultural resources can be used to support this sustainable growth. However, the characterization represents the first step towards a targeted and proficient exploitation of the chemical and energetic potential of a residual biomass. In this work, some representative residual (Mexican) biomasses were investigated: pepper residues (Hungarian yellow and red variety), coconut shells (Cocos nucifera), flamboyant pods (Delonix regia), seeds of avocado (Persea Americana), palm (Palma de Coroco) and nance (Byrsonima crassifolia) were chemically characterized and the relevant potential applications for the synthesis of biofuels and fine chemicals were specifically evaluated. Lipids, structural carbohydrates, and lignin were specifically valorized in a proficient cascade of technologies, which aim to exploit the correspondent potential, according to the principles of biorefinery and circular economy. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Algal biomass is regarded as a sustainable energy feedstock for the future. Enhancement of the biomass and metabolite production of microalgae increases the economic feasibility of the biofuel production process. The present study encompasses on bioethanol production from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii through a biorefinery approach. The biomass and carbohydrate productivity of C. reinhardtii UTEX 90 and CC 2656 were enhanced by optimizing the physico-chemical parameters. The following conditions were found suitable for the improvement of biomass and metabolite content of C. reinhardtii: pH 6.5–7.0, incubation temperature 30 °C, initial acetate and ammonium chloride concentration of 1.56 g L−1 and 100–200 mg L−1, respectively. Under the optimized operational condition biomass and carbohydrate productivity of C. reinhardtii UTEX 90 and CC 2656 were 512 mg L−1 d−1 &amp; 266.24 mg L−1 d−1 and 364 mg L−1 d −1 &amp; 163.80 mg L−1 d−1, respectively. The amount of CO2 sequestered during the cultivation process by UTEX 90 and CC 2656 were 113 mg L−1 d−1 and 74.95 mg L−1 d−1, respectively. The depigmented and defatted carbohydrate rich biomass was considered as raw material for bioethanol production. The bioethanol yield range was 90–94% of the theoretical yield using Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSC-1 in a double jacket reactor. To improve the viability of the process, the spent media after ethanol fermentation was subsequently used for methane production using mixed microbial consortium. The energy recovery from the process was 40.39% and 39.7% for UTEX 90 and CC 2656, respectively when C. reinhardtii biomass was used as substrate for biofuel production. The present investigation concedes with the potentiality of algae as a favourable 3rd generation feedstock to address the existing challenges of clean energy production with concomitant CO2 sequestration. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In order to valorize the end-of-life euro banknotes (ELEBs), the substrates were used in this research for cellulase production via submerged fungal fermentation (SFF), and the resultant fungal cellulase w s used in ELEBs hydrolysis process for extraction of glucose. The experiments were started by exposing the ELEBs to different types of pretreatments, including milling process, alkali (NaOH/urea solution), and acid leaching to remove any contamination (e.g. dyes) and to decrease the crystallinity of cellulose (the main element in cotton substrate) thus increasing the degradation rate during the fermentation process. The effect of pretreatments on the morphology and chemical composition of ELEBs was observed using Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive Spectrometry. Afterwards, Trichoderma reesei-DSM76 was used for cellulase production from the treated ELEBs with high cellulase activity (12.97 FPU/g). The resultant cellulase was upscaled in a bioreactor and used in ELEBs hydrolysis. Finally, the results showed that the optimized pretreatment methods (milling followed by leaching process) significantly improved the cellulase activity and glucose recovery, which was estimated by 96%. According to the obtained results, the developed strategy has a great potential for conversion of ELEBs into a glucose product that could be used in biofuels and bioplastics applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study has investigated on two objectives which are enhancing the microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana CY-1 cell disruption mechanism using thermal Fenton reaction and performing non-catalytic transesterification by ultra-sonication method. Radicles generated by Fenton reaction are rapid, dynamic, and the reaction was assisted by thermal heating to optimize the kinetic of the radical generation by obtained the lipid recovery for 53.3% and 977.41 mg/g at 36.5 °C with 4 min of contact time. The conversion of lipid into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) through rapid non-catalytic transesterification using ultrasound was also performed. The significant parameters were done by varying the ratio of methanol to lipid, duration and pulse mode of sonication, to optimize the bonding reaction with methyl ester compound to free fatty acids. The formation of hydrocarbon chains with C4, C6, and C10 was observed at 8.20 mg/g, 0.33 mg/g, and 0.24 mg/g, respectively. This is a promising method as it is marketable and can be conducted in large scale with high process yield of F.A.M.E in a rapid manner. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) is a second generation biofuel that can be produced from vegetable oil and hydrogen via hydroprocessing. BHD is considered as one of alternative and renewable energy. This work presents evaluation of environmental impacts of BHD produced from palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) compared to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). Greenhouse gas emission, energy consumption, and overall environmental impacts are assessed. System boundary is from palm oil cultivation to BHD production. The functional unit is defined as 1 kg of fuel produced at the plant. The results indicate that energy consumption of BHD-PFAD is 1.18 times higher than that of BHD-FAME, while giving GHG emission 13.56 times lower than that of BHD-FAME. The results of overall environmental impacts indicated that BHD-PFAD was 3.58 greater than that of BHD-FAME. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Efficient electrocatalytic energy conversion requires devices to function reversibly, that is, to deliver a substantial current at a minimal overpotential. Redox-active films can effectively embed and stabilize molecular electrocatalysts, but mediated electron transfer through the film typically makes the catalytic response irreversible. Here we describe a redox-active film for bidirectional (oxidation or reduction) and reversible hydrogen conversion, which consists of [FeFe] hydrogenase embedded in a low-potential, 2,2′-viologen-modified hydrogel. When this catalytic film served as the anode material in a H2/O2 biofuel cell, an open circuit voltage of 1.16 V was obtained—a benchmark value near the thermodynamic limit. The same film also acted as a highly energy efficient cathode material for H2 evolution. We explained the catalytic properties using a kinetic model, which shows that reversibility can be achieved even though intermolecular electron transfer is slower than catalysis. This understanding of reversibility simplifies the design principles of highly efficient and stable bioelectrocatalytic films, advancing their implementation in energy conversion.

AB  - Advanced biofuels are among the available options to decarbonise transport in the short to medium term especially for aviation, marine and heavy-duty vehicles that lack immediate alternatives. Their production and market uptake, however, is still very low due to several challenges arising across their value chain. So far policy has established targets and monitoring frameworks for low carbon fuels and improved engine performance but has not yet been sufficient to facilitate their effective market uptake. Their market roll-out must be immediate if the 2030 targets are to be met. Analysis in this paper reiterates that the future deployment of these fuels, in market shares that can lead to the desired decarbonisation levels, still depends largely on the integration of tailored policy interventions that can overcome challenges and improve upstream and downstream performance. The work presented aims to i) inform on policy relevant challenges that restrict the flexible, reliable and cost-efficient market uptake of sustainable advanced biofuels for transport, and ii) highlight policy interventions that, have strong potential to overcome the challenges and are relevant to current policy, Green Deal and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The demand for economic and efficient electrode for energy storage devices has been increased with the rapid advancements in the sustainable synthesis of active material. Herein, bioactive compounds as fuel for the synthesis of electrode material (Co3O4 NPs), were investigated. Functionalization of Co3O4 NPs via organic extract of Euphorbia cognata Boiss have not only revealed the rapid and efficient growth of active materials but also ensured an effective interaction between the fabricated electrode and electrolyte solution for charge storage reactions. The synthesized Co3O4 NPs were scrutinized for its optical, structural, compositional and chemical properties and then investigated by galvanostatic charge discharge, cyclicvoltammetry for determination of its energy storage potential. The fabricated electrode was tested at range of scan rates and current densities to evaluate its charge storage potential at different scan rates and current densities. The phytofunctionalized Co3O4 NPs offered a large accessible active sites for charge storage with capacitance of 103 Fg-1, a maximum energy density of 1.9 Whkg−1, and higher power density of 4.7 KWkg−1. Thus, we have demonstrated the sustainable fabrication of electrode for energy storage applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The direct injection dual-fuel intelligent charge compression ignition (ICCI) is demonstrated as an advanced combustion mode with high efficiency and low emissions at medium to high engine loads, owing to the flexible in-cylinder concentration control of two fuels with different reactivity. Due to the incomplete combustion of part fuels, the improvement of efficiency and emissions under low load is always very difficult for most of new combustion modes. To deal with this problem, this paper systematically analyzed the combined effect of intake temperature, intake pressure, direct injection timings and the corresponding energy ratio of the two fuels on ICCI combustion strategy fueled with biofuels of butanol and biodiesel at indicated mean effective pressure of 4 bar. Results show that the high efficiency, low hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) emissions are obtained at relative high intake temperature and low intake pressure condition. Sufficiently advance direct injection timing (SOI1) of the butanol could shorten the combustion duration and improve indicated thermal efficiency (ITE), along with the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and PM emissions, while the ignition delay is insensitive to SOI1. MPRR is significantly reduced with the advance of direct injection timing of biodiesel (SOI2), which improves the combustion process and reduces pollutant emissions, especially for NOx emissions. CO and HC emissions increase at first and then decrease with the advance of SOI2. Based on the optimized intake boundary conditions, as the butanol energy ratio is upgraded, the ITE shows slightly decrease at first and then increase, but the NOx emissions are close to zero. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In conventional biomass-to-biofuel production processes, cellulose and hemicellulose are converted only to biofuels. However, to improve the economics of the process, it is desirable that some fractions of biomass be produced as fuels and other fractions as chemicals. This coproduction of fuels and chemicals also enables a flexible response to the market conditions of bioproducts, rather than producing only biofuels or biochemicals. Moreover, the use of all fractions, not only cellulose and hemicellulose but also lignin, improves the economics of the process. We propose a biorefinery strategy for the coproduction of liquid hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, all three primary components of biomass were converted into high-value products that can be commercialized: (1) cellulose, which is converted into butene oligomers (BO) for transportation fuels, (2) hemicellulose, which is converted into 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO) that can be used as polyester and polyurethane components, and (3) lignin, which is converted into carbon products, such as carbon fibers or battery anodes. By maximizing the biomass utilization up to 47.8% from biomass to valuable products, the economic viability of the proposed process can be increased. Technoeconomic analysis shows that the minimum selling price of BO is $4.21 per gallon of gasoline equivalent in the integrated strategy, indicating that it is a promising alternative to current biofuel production approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Compression ignition engines powered by diesel are the work horses of developing countries like India. However, burning fossil fuel causes a lot of air pollution and the depletion of fuel at an alarming rate. Fuels produced from biomass or wastes can partially substitute fossil diesel to decrease its consumption. One such feedstock is waste cooking oil (WCO) which can be easily converted into fuel for diesel engines. The hydrotreating process stands out among the methods available for converting WCO into fuel, since its properties are almost similar to fossil diesel with little or no oxygen content. In this study, the physico-chemical properties of the hydrotreated waste cooking oil (HVO), biodiesel of waste cooking oil, diesel and blends of HVO and diesel are compared. The blends were prepared by mixing 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% of HVO on volume basis in diesel. The evaporation rate and ignition probability of the fuel samples were found by using a hot-plate test setup. HVO had higher ignition probability than all the test sample. As the percentage of HVO increased in the test samples, the ignition probability increased. The Sauter mean diameter (SMD) of the samples was also found using Malvern Spraytec. The SMD of HVO was larger than diesel but smaller than biodiesel. The study shows that blends of HVO up to 30% are feasible for present use in diesel engines, as the viscosity (2.54, 2.59 and 2.62cSt) and calorific value (42.41, 42.29, 42.08 MJ/kg) of the three blends (10%, 20% and 30%) is close to diesel (2.51cSt and 42.58 MJ/kg). Also, due to high cetane index, neat HVO or blends having higher HVO content (> 30%) cannot be used in the existing engines as the engine power output may be affected. Therefore, to use these fuels, the engine needs to be modified which is not feasible for existing engines. The FTIR and GC-MS analysis shows that the HVO has low oxygen content and high amount of paraffins, whereas biodiesel of waste cooking oil has high unsaturation and high oxygen content. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - With the rapid growth in population and urbanization, a development in sustainable treatment of sewage sludge has become an urgent environmental concern globally. Lipid extraction has been investigated in order to valorize waste sewage sludge treatment through a pathway that leads to biodiesel. In this work, an integrated approach that combines lipid extraction of sewage sludge with hydrothermal liquefaction of the lipid-extracted sludge was studied in order to maximize valorization. The hydrothermal process was performed at temperatures ranging from 250 to 350 °C with 20 min. Regarding the bio-crude: below 300 °C, similar values are found with and without lipid-extraction, with the former variant containing more nitrogenated compounds stemming from Maillard reactions, while the latter more hydrocarbons; at 350 °C, higher bio-crude is obtained from raw sewage sludge owning to the conversion of lipids. Palmitic acid was selected as a model lipid to elucidate the role of lipids during the process, as well as to provide an improved understanding of the reaction network. Energy recovery reached values of 85.4% for hydrothermal liquefaction of sewage sludge and 98.3% for integrated approach considering the whole range of biofuel products. The energy consumption ratio was applied to estimate energetic efficiency for the combined process, making it possible to estimate the breakeven point of the process, plus the efficiency of both the hydrothermal process on its own in comparison with the combined option. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work investigates the opportunity of retrofitting existing small-scale gasifiers shifting from combined heat and power (CHP) to hydrogen and biofuels production, using steam and biomass residues (woodchips, vineyard pruning and bark). The experiments were carried out in a batch reactor at 700 °C and 800 °C and at different steam flow (SF) rates (0.04 g/min and 0.20 g/min). The composition of the producer gas is in the range of 46–70 % H2, 9–29 % CO, 12–27 % CO2, and 2–6 % CH4. A producer gas specific production factor of approx. 10 NLpg/gchar can be achieved when the lower SFs are used, which allows to provide 80 % of the hydrogen concentration required for biomethanation and MeOH synthesis. As for FT synthesis, an optimal H2/CO ratio of approx. 2 can be achieved. The results of this work provide further evidence towards the feasibility of hydrogen and biofuels generation from residual biomass through steam gasification. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - An integrated process that includes catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass/plastic wastes and in-line catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis gas were conducted to simultaneously produce aromatics-rich bio-oil and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The influences of feedstocks blending ratio on the characteristics of bio-oil and CNTs were established. The reaction mechanism of carbon deposition during the system was also probed. The results showed that co-feeding plastic to biomass siginificantly enhanced the selectivity of monoaromatics (benzene, toluene, and xylene) from 5.6% for pure biomass to the maximum yield of 44.4% for 75.0% plastic ratio, and decreased naphthalene and its derivates from 85.9 to 41.7% correspondingly. The most synergistic effect on BTX selectivity occurred at 25% of plastic ratio. The multi-walled CNTs were successfully synethsized on Ni catalyst by utilizing prolysis gas as feedstocks. For pure biomass, the least CNTs yield with ultrafine diameters of 3.9–8.5 nm was generated via disproportionation reaction of CO which was derived from decarboxylation and decarbonylation of oxygenates on the ZSM-5 acid sites. With the rise of plastic ratio, sufficient hydrocarbons were produced for CNTs growth, endowing CNTs with long and straight tube walls, along with uniform diameters (~16 nm). The CNTs yield increased as high as 139 mg/g-cata. In addition, the decreased CO2 inhibited dry reforming with C1-C4 hydrocarbons and deposited carbon, avoiding excessive etching of CNTs. Thereby, high-purity CNTs with less defects were fabricated when plastic ratio was beyond 50% in the feedstock. The strategy is expected to improve the sustainability and economic viability of biomass pyrolysis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential application of biodevices based on enzymatic bioelectrocatalysis are limited by poor stability and electrochemical performance. To solve the limitation, modifying enzyme with functional polymer to tailor enzyme function is highly desirable. Herein, glucose oxidase (GOx) was chosen as a model enzyme, and according to the chemical structure of GOx cofactor (flavin adenine dinucleotide, FAD), we customize a biomimetic cofactor containing vinyl group (SFAD) for GOx, and prepared an GOx nanocapsule via in-situ polymerization. The characterization of particle size distribution, TEM, fluorescence and electrochemical performance indicated the successful formation of electroactive GOx nanocapsule with SFAD-containing polymeric network (n (GOx-SFAD-PAM)). The network can act as an electronic “highway” to link the active site with electrode, with capability to accelerate electron transfer as well as enhanced GOx stability. Further investigation of bioelectrocatalysis shows that n (GOx-SFAD-PAM)-based biosensor has low detection potential (−0.4 vs. Ag/AgCl), high sensitivity (64.97 μAmM−1cm−2), good anti-interference performance, quick response (3⁓5s) and excellent stability, and that n (GOx-SFAD-PAM)-based enzymatic biofuel cell (EBFC) has the high maximum power density (1011.21 μWcm−2), which is a 385-fold increase over that of native GOx-based EBFC (2.62 μWcm−2). This study suggests that novel enzyme nanocapsule with electroactive polymeric shell might provide a prospective solution for the performance improvement of enzymatic bioelectrocatalysis-based biodevices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A dual-function cellulose nanofiber (CNF)-based bionic biosensor with good biocompatibility was developed for detecting Ag+ and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by grafting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) onto CNF. The Ag+ ions captured by the biosensor acted as recognition sites for the detection of AChE. The CNF-based bionic biosensor (CNF-DNA) could detect Ag+ concentrations as low as 10−6 nM in the presence of interference metal ions (Hg2+, Ba2+, Cd2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+). DNA-template silver nanoclusters (DNA-AgNCs) were formed on the surface of CNF-DNA during the detection of Ag+ (CNF-DNA-AgNCs). This new strategy yielded CNF-DNA-AgNCs through the adsorption of Ag+ ions onto the cytosine base of the single-stranded DNA in CNF-DNA without the use of any additional reducer. Meanwhile, the CNF-DNA-AgNCs exhibited excellent sensitivity and selectivity for trace levels (0.053 mU/mL) of AChE in the presence of interference reagents. The novel strategy proposed in this paper may establish a foundation for further research on DNA-template AgNCs for developing biosensors and biomarkers for in vivo and in vitro detection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The production of ‘Jet Biofuel’ has been identified as a promising strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of the aviation sector. During the past decade, the commercial production of Jet Biofuel has attracted the attention of airline companies and governments across the globe. However, achieving a competitive production cost and sustainable Jet Biofuel remains a challenge. In this regard, various feedstocks have been tested for this purpose, where the vast majority have not complied with sustainability and feasibility expectations. Although not fully utilised in the Jet Biofuel industry, Jatropha curcas has emerged as one of the most promising feedstocks for Jet Biofuel production, since it is non-edible and is able to grow in non-arable lands with minimal water and energy requirements. This study presents a novel integrated pathway that utilises all parts of Jatropha fruit to produce a cost-effective Jet Biofuel using conventional hydroprocess, gasification, Fischer-Tropsch and reforming technologies. Different integration techniques are employed, including waste valorisation, by-products incorporation, as well as water, heat and power integration. The effect of various operating parameters on the products’ characteristics and yields has been evaluated. The model is validated against literature experimental data and demonstrates promising results. Whereby, 49 wt% of Jatropha fruit is converted into liquid fuels, with a Jet Biofuel selectivity of 65%, which represents an increment of almost 88% of Jet Biofuel yield compared to processing Jatropha oil alone. Furthermore, the system developed is power and water self-sufficient. The proposed pathway significantly lowers the production cost of Jet Biofuel below the market price of conventional Jet-A fuel for the base year of analysis, achieving a minimum selling price of 0.445 $/kg. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - In this work, ammonia (NH3) torrefaction pretreatment (ATP) was developed to optimize the nitrogen and oxygen element distribution of microalgae via the N-doping and oxygen removal reaction, which could obviously improve the potential use of microalgae as a feedstock for the production of N-heterocyclic chemicals through fast pyrolysis technology. The nitrogen content increased from 8.3% of raw microalgae to 11.51% at 300 °C of ATP, while the oxygen content decreased from 35.96% to 21.61%, because of the Maillard reactions. In addition, the nitrogen-doping ratio and oxygen removal ratio of ATP was much higher than the conventional nitrogen torrefaction pretreatment (NTP). With the increase of ATP torrefaction temperature or the pyrolysis temperature, the relative content of the N-containing compounds increased, while the O-containing compounds decreased. For the N-heterocyclic chemicals, higher pyrolysis temperature favored the formation of pyrroles, while inhibited the formation of pyridines and indoles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Polymerization is a major challenge for the upgrading of bio-oil to biofuels, but is preferable for the production of carbon material from bio-oil. Understanding the mechanism for polymerization is of importance for tailoring property of carbon material. This study investigated the characteristics for the polymerisation of furfural, vanillin, their cross-polymerization and the impacts of catalysts on their polymerization. The results indicated that the organic acids like acetic acid and formic acid could catalyze the polymerisation of furfural, while H2SO4 or NaOH as catalyst could drastically enhance the degree of polymerization of furfural. Vanillin showed a higher tendency towards polymerization than furfural and H2SO4 or NaOH significantly facilitated the polymerization of vanillin via shifting the pasty product to solid polymer. The cross-polymerization between furfural and vanillin occurred even in the absence of catalyst, while the presence of H2SO4 or NaOH catalyst resulted in the formation of more solid polymer via cross-polymerization. The polymerisation reactions were accompanied with the consumption of –C=O via aldol addition/condensation reactions. In addition, the morphology and thermal stability of the polymers formed were affected by both the type of the catalysts employed, which can in turn enhance the cross-polymerization between furfural and vanillin. © 2020 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effect of microwave torrefaction and ZSM-5 catalyst for hydrocarbon rich bio-oil production from microwave co-pyrolysis of cellulose and low density polyethylene (LDPE). FTIR analysis displayed remarkable reductions of active hydroxyl and ether groups in microwave torrefied cellulose (MTC), demonstrating that cellulose was less stable than MTC. GC/MS analysis indicated that the hydrocarbons content was ranged from 18.36% to 54.94% in the obtained bio-oils under different conditions, and the maximum hydrocarbons content (54.94%) which also contained the highest aromatic hydrocarbons (19.49%) was obtained from MTC catalytic co-pyrolysis. Microwave-assisted Thermogravimetric analyzer (MW-TGA) analysis showed that MTC catalytic co-pyrolysis apparently shifted the major thermal degradation to a lower temperature area, an evident synergistic effect was observed during MTC catalytic co-pyrolysis. Kinetics study revealed that the activation energy was significantly reduced from 97.87 kJ/mol to 63.86 kJ/mol for co-pyrolysis and MTC catalytic co-pyrolysis, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The search for biofuel in order to complement the future shortage of fuels and mitigate the poisonous air and water pollution has become so considerate in the last few decades. The choice of feedstock and catalyst system for biofuel production has been very difficult considering many drawbacks from food-fuel competition to catalyst separation and water washing after the reaction. To address these issues, acid-base bi-functional catalysts and waste based vegetable oil were considered for the sustainable production of biofuels. Bifunctional catalyst has the capacity to successfully transform waste based vegetable oil into useful biofuel under mild reaction parameters. In this work, a newly developed bimetallic tungsten- zirconia (W–Zr) modified waste shell catalyst samples were employed for the simultaneous esterification and transesterification of unrefined palm-derived waste oil (PDWO) to biodiesel in one-pot reaction. These catalysts were successfully synthesized using simple wet impregnation technique and characterized by SEM, BET, XRD, and TPD characterization techniques. The catalyst was able to achieved the maximum biodiesel yield of 94.1% in 1 h under optimized reaction parameters. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Two different SCR catalysts, V2O5-WO3/TiO2 and Cu-SSZ-13, were exposed to biodiesel exhausts generated by a diesel burner. The effect of phosphorus and sulfur on the SCR performance of these catalysts was investigated by doping the fuel with P-, S-, or P + S-containing compounds. Elemental analyses showed that both catalysts captured phosphorus while only Cu-SSZ-13 captured sulfur. High molar P/V ratios, up to almost 3, were observed for V2O5-WO3/TiO2, while the highest P/Cu ratios observed were slightly above 1 for the Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst. Although the V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst captured more P than did the Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst, a higher degree of deactivation was observed for the latter, especially at low temperatures. For both catalysts, phosphorus exposure resulted in suppression of the SCR performance over the entire temperature range. Sulfur exposure, on the other hand, resulted in deactivation of the Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst mainly at temperatures below 300-350 °C. The use of an oxidation catalyst upstream of the SCR catalyst during the exhaust-exposure protects the SCR catalyst from phosphorus poisoning by capturing phosphorus. The results in this work will improve the understanding of chemical deactivation of SCR catalysts and aid in developing durable aftertreatment systems. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Biodiesel obtained from low-cost non-edible oils is the most promising alternative fuel for conventional diesel fuel. In this current work, Prunus domestica kernel oil was used as a feedstock for synthesizing methyl ester. The FFA value of the kernel oil was examined by employing the isopropyl alcohol technique and found to be 11.63 mg KOH/g. Hence, oil was processed with a two-step transesterification process using acid (H2SO4) and base (NaOH) catalyst reaction to convert into biodiesel. To obtain maximum yield and high-quality biodiesel, an optimization technique was employed. In this technique, the process parameters such as experimental duration, reaction temperature, NaOH concentration, and methanol to oil ratio were optimized based on Taguchi technique. The investigations revealed that 150 min, 60°C, 8:1 ratio, and 1 wt% NaOH were optimal process parameters obtained with a reaction efficiency of 97.86%. The experimental analysis considered that the methanol to oil ratio was happened to be the most substantial entity using ANOVA. The biodiesel Prunus domestica methyl ester produced matched and fulfilled the standards EN14214. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biodiesel is a typical renewable and green energy, that is usually produced by the transesterification of edible vegetable oils. However, the cost of edible vegetable oils as feedstock accounts for 60%–80% of the total cost of biodiesel production. To overcome these issues, in this work, a low-cost feedstock, waste phoenix seed oil (PSO) with a high free fatty acid (FFA) content (30.1 ± 0.6%), consisting of the main fatty acid, linoleic acid (30.2%), oleic acid (22.2%), and palmitic acid (17.4%), was developed as a new feedstock to prepare biodiesel. A novel one-step method including simultaneous esterification of FFAs and transesterification of the PSO to prepare biodiesel was developed. Free lipase was used as catalyst. The influences of the reaction parameters were explored and optimized by response surface methodology. The results showed that the free lipase Lipozyme TL100L from Thermomyces lanuginosus can simultaneously catalyze esterification and transesterification. Under the optimum conditions (enzyme load 9.7%, reaction time 6.9 h, reaction temperature 31 °C and substrate ratio (methanol/PSO) 4.3: 1 (mol/mol)), the maximum biodiesel yield (93.8 ± 0.5%) was achieved. The activation energy from biodiesel preparation using PSO with a high FFA content was 39.7 kJ/mol. Furthermore, the kinetic values for K'm and Vmax were 0.18 mol/L and 0.043 mol/(L·min), respectively. The reaction mechanism of the simultaneous esterification and transesterification was also proposed. These results indicate that PSO with a high FFA content can be used as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2020

AB  - The present experimental investigation has shown the biodiesel production from 2nd generation renewable carbon source, Karanja seed oil using graphene oxide (GO) immobilized lipase biocatalyst. The adsorption of lipase in GO was found to be most suitable immobilizing support matrix (adsorbed ~94 mg/g of GO) due to large specific surface area and abundant functional groups. The GO immobilized enzyme i.e. biocatalysts assisted enzymatic transesterification yielded ~88% of biodiesel using 1:8 Karanja oil: ethanol ratio, 25 °C, 3% biocatalysts in 24 h reaction time. The newly designed solar-driven direct contact membrane distillation module enables continuous separation and recycles of unreacted alcohol (&gt;99% recovery) from transesterification reaction mixture while yielding ~41 Kg EtOH/m2/24h using commercial PTFE/PET hydrophobic membrane. Subsequently, free glycerol was removed up to ~77% (permeate concentration ≤0.018 mass%) by cross-flow membrane module fitted with flat-sheet polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane. The integration of GO-based biocatalyst assisted transesterification and multi-staged membrane system for downstream enrichment of fatty acid ethyl ester culminates in the development of a cost-effective, energy-intensive and eco-friendly system which represents a sustainable biofuel production process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: In this study, wild-type microalgae species isolated from Porsuk river (Central Anatolia, Turkey) investigated as energy production feedstock and carbon dioxide sink. The obtained experimental data have been used for energy evaluation of the whole process and size estimation of large scale microalgae plant. Growth rate, CO2 mitigation rate, lipid, carbohydrate and protein content and natural settling behavior of the isolated species were investigated. The microalgae Gleocystis ampula had the highest growth rate equal to 0.138 ± 0.008 g l−1 d−1 which also was observed to fix carbon dioxide with the highest rate of 0.281 ± 0.025 g l−1 d−1. The highest measured lipid content of 47.32 ± 0.40 wt% belonged to Scenedesmus quadricauda (I) with an estimated lipid production rate of 51.9 ± 0.4 mg l−1 d−1. The species Kirchneriella lunaris showed the highest carbohydrate proportion being 72.43 ± 6.40 and Micrococcus sp. had the highest protein content of 58.11 ± 8.5 wt%. Promising large scale application of microalgae was concluded for biodiesel production and carbon dioxide mitigation just when efficiency of processes improved substantially. An Energy Efficiency of 1.62 was estimated following an ideally designed cultivation and dewatering approach. Graphic Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Algal-derived bioenergy is one of the best alternative energy sources to replace fossil-based fuels. Algae are a diverse collection of oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms with rapid growth capacity that utilise commonly available materials for growth. Biological CO2 mitigation using microalgae is an environmentally friendly and economical method. Besides this, algae are able to live in extreme environments containing high amounts of heavy metals, making this a useful way to treat wastewater. The biomass produced from algae also can be used as a source of energy, chemicals and food. However, to ensure that the optimum blooming capacity is reached for the production of high-yield biomass for bioenergy resources, growth factors such as absorbed CO2, nutrient availability, light energy, temperature, pH and agitation should be studied comprehensively. This article provides a selective overview of the past and present studies of algal growth and the factors that affect the production of algal biomass. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The availability of organic matters in vast quantities from the agricultural/industrial practices has long been a significant environmental challenge. These wastes have created global issues in increasing the levels of BOD or COD in water as well as in soil or air segments. Such wastes can be converted into bioenergy using a specific conversion platform in conjunction with the appropriate utilization of the methods such as anaerobic digestion, secondary waste treatment, or efficient hydrolytic breakdown as these can promote bioenergy production to mitigate the environmental issues. By the proper utilization of waste organics and by adopting innovative approaches, one can develop bioenergy processes to meet the energy needs of the society. Waste organic matters from plant origins or other agro-sources, biopolymers, or complex organic matters (cellulose, hemicelluloses, non-consumable starches or proteins) can be used as cheap raw carbon resources to produce biofuels or biogases to fulfill the ever increasing energy demands. Attempts have been made for bioenergy production by biosynthesizing, methanol, n-butanol, ethanol, algal biodiesel, and biohydrogen using different types of organic matters via biotechnological/chemical routes to meet the world's energy need by producing least amount of toxic gases (reduction up to 20–70% in concentration) in order to promote sustainable green environmental growth. This review emphasizes on the nature of available wastes, different strategies for its breakdown or hydrolysis, efficient microbial systems. Some representative examples of biomasses source that are used for bioenergy production by providing critical information are discussed. Furthermore, bioenergy production from the plant-based organic matters and environmental issues are also discussed. Advanced biofuels from the organic matters are discussed with efficient microbial and chemical processes for the promotion of biofuel production from the utilization of plant biomasses. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis bio-oil is unsuitable as transportation fuel due to its chemical composition and high oxygen (&gt;30 wt%) and water (&gt;20 wt%) content rendering the upgrading essential prior any downstream use. The current work investigates the upgrading of a flash pyrolysis bio-oil via mild hydrotreatment (HDT), targeting to a potential intermediate refinery feed. Various operating parameters of HDT were tested, including three temperatures (573, 603 and 633 K), two pressures (4 and 7 MPa) and two H2/bio-oil ratios (506 and 843 NL/L). According to the results, during HDT of bio-oil, massive plugging by coke formed in the reactor. The unsaturated oxygenates in bio-oil are regarded as the predominant coke precursors since they can interact with the catalytic surface. From all the examined conditions, it was found that the longest catalyst life, (5 days on stream), was achieved at 7 MPa pressure, 843 NL/L H2/bio-oil ratio and 603 K temperature. Furthermore, several properties of the initial bio-oil were improved, such as viscosity (156 → 4.9 cSt), carboxylic acids (78 → 0.2 mgKOH/g), density (1.024 → 0.9162 g/ml), and oxygen content (37 → 4 wt%). Conclusively, mild HDT constitutes a promising technological pathway for bio-oil upgrading towards a reliable intermediate refinery feed. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Biodiesel, an unconventional fuel to substitute the existing fossil diesel, is non-toxic, biodegradable, possesses high lubricity and better combustion capacity. In this paper, a new eco-friendly solid catalyst was developed from anthill-zinc modification for methanolysis of low-grade feedstock (waste cooking oil, WCO) to make biodiesel. The zinc-modified anthill was prepared via the sol-gel technique and characterized by EDX, TGA/DTA, FTIR, XRD, SEM, BET and CO2-TPD. The optimum experimental conditions obtained by a central composite design were 17.99:1, 0.51 wt%, and 66.54 °C for the molar ratio of methanol to WCO, catalyst loading and reaction temperature, respectively. At these optimum values, the highest experimentally obtained biodiesel yield was 83.16%, which matched the predicted value (82.71%) reasonably well with R2 = 0.9914. According to gas chromatography analysis, the fatty acid methyl ester conversion under optimum conditions was 97.05%. While 20% blending of biodiesel on a volume basis with petroleum-based diesel showed remarkable fuel properties, the catalyst exhibited better stability after being regenerated and reused for six cycles. This study extends the frontier of knowledge in the economical production of biofuels from waste products. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Giant reed (Arundo donax L.) is a promising source of carbohydrates that can be converted into single cell oil (SCO) by oleaginous yeasts. Microbial conversion of both hemicellulose and cellulose fractions represents the key step for increasing the economic sustainability for SCO production. Lipomyces starkeyi DSM 70,296 was cultivated in two xylose-rich hydrolysates, obtained by the microwave-assisted hydrolysis of hemicellulose catalysed by FeCl3 or Amberlyst-70, and in two glucose-rich hydrolysates obtained by the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose. L. starkeyi grew on both undetoxified and partially-detoxified hydrolysates, achieving the lipid content of 30 wt% and yield values in the range 15–24 wt%. For both integrated cascade processes the final production of about 8 g SCO from 100 g biomass was achieved. SCO production through integrated hydrolysis cascade processes represents a promising solution for the effective exploitation of lignocellulosic feedstock from perennial grasses towards new generation biodiesel and other valuable bio-based products. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Environmental problems, combined with a finite supply of fossil fuels, have made the use of renewable energy sources necessary. Biomass is a renewable source of energy that has played a very important role in energy production in recent years. Because there are a number of technologies that can be used to convert biomass into energy, it is important to select the best option. The fact that multiple options are available that need to be evaluated based on a set of decision-making criteria makes this a multicriteria decision-making problem. This paper takes the first step in proposing an evaluation framework and identifying the importance of the relevant decision-making criteria in biofuel production technology selection. To determine the importance of the selection criteria, experts were asked to respond to an online questionnaire based on the best-worst method. The results indicate that air pollution, land use change, and human expertise are the three most important criteria for selecting the best biofuel production technology in our case country, Iran. © 1988-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Microbial fuel cells can be efficiently used for simultaneous cleaning of wastewater and generation of electricity. This research demonstrates the applicability of Baker yeast cells in the design of microbial biofuel cells. The applicability the 9,10-phenantrenequinone (PQ) as a redox mediator in the design of yeast-based microbial cell (MFC) for the improvement of charge transfer through the yeast cell membrane and cell wall towards the electrode was evaluated. The viability of bakers' yeast and pure Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell strains was investigated by evaluating the growth velocity of cells in the presence of a different concentration of PQ in solution. The growth curves of bakers' yeast showed that they were more resistant to PQ. Electrochemical measurements were performed with PQ as a redox mediator, which was (i) dissolved in solution and (ii) adsorbed on a graphite electrode. Differently modified graphite electrodes (namely: (i) non-modified, (ii) yeast-modified, (iii) modified by PQ and yeast) were evaluated. The modified electrodes were evaluated as anodes of MFC. The dependence of potential on external resistance and generated power of MFC was evaluated. Maximal open circuit potential was 178 mV at 7.8 mM of glucose and 23 mM of potassium ferricyanide. Maximal power of BFC calculated at the same conditions was registered at 56 mV, and it reached 22.2 mW/m2 (at 30 mM of glucose). The application of PQ as a redox mediator for yeast-based MFC improves electron transfer through the yeast cell membrane and cell wall towards electrode without any noticeable decrease of yeast cell viability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A solid acid catalyst prepared by sulfonated Sargassum horneri carbon was utilized for the esterification reaction of oleic acid and methanol. The formed amorphous carbon layers during carbonization and the access of sulfonic acid groups during sulfonation can catalyze the esterification reaction for biodiesel preparation efficiently. The catalyst was characterized by various methods to investigate its physical and chemical properties. With carbonization at 300 °C for 2 h followed by sulfonation at 90 °C for 5 h, the catalyst reached acid density of 1.40 mmol/g. The catalyst dosage, methanol/oleic acid (molar ratio), reaction temperature, and reaction time were optimized to 10 wt%, 15:1, 70 °C, and 3 h, respectively. Under the optimal condition, the conversion of oleic acid reached 96.4%. Additionally, the catalyst was regenerated after four cycles, with the conversion of oleic acid still reaching 95.4%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The magnetic graphene oxide (GO) supported with heterogeneous ternary mixed metal oxide (MMO) was used as nanocatalyst to enhance the conversion of waste frying oil (WFO) triglycerides to biodiesel via esterification process. In this regard, acidic MGO was modified with three basic metal cations of cerium, zirconium, and strontium oxides to produce heterogeneous MGO@MMO nanocatalyst. The nanocatalyst was characterized by FESEM, TEM, EDX and FTIR. The influence of different parameters such as catalyst material ratio, methanol to oil ratio, contact time, and reaction temperature was studied. Based on the results of effecting parameters, the MGO@MMO nanocatalyst converted WFO to biodiesel with a yield 94%, a reaction time of 90 min, methanol to oil ratio (8:1), and a temperature of 60 °C. Esterification mechanism indicated the MGO@MMO nanocatalyst having both binary Brønsted acid–base sites that increased the conversion yields as compared to MGO and MMO at low temperatures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - It has been reported that anaerobic osmosis membrane bioreactors have the potential for energy recovery since dissolved methane was almost rejected by commercial forward osmosis membranes. Notwithstanding, upgraded biogas has to be achieved by removing as much carbon dioxide as possible. In this study, a novel anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor-microbial electrolysis cell (AnOMBR-MEC) system was developed for simultaneous biogas upgrading and wastewater treatment. The AnOMBR-MEC elicited an excellent and stable soluble chemical oxygen demand and phosphorus removal. As the experiment progressed, unwanted carbon dioxide produced from biogas was reduced to formate using a SnO2 nanoparticles electrocatalytic cathode in an electrocatalytic-assisted MEC, with the highest faradic efficiency of formate being 85% at 1.2V. Compared to AnOMBR, the methane content increased from 55% to 90% at the end of operation and methane yield experienced a1.6-fold increment in the AnOMBR-MEC. Microbial community analysis revealed that hydrogenotrophic methanogens (e.g. Methanobacterium and Methanobrevibacter) converted the produced H2 and formate to methane at saline conditions. These results have demonstrated an efficient strategy based on the integration of an electrocatalytic-assisted MEC into AnOMBR for upgrading biogas, enhancing methane yield and wastewater treatment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae under milder reaction conditions was studied for the production and characterization of high quality biocrude oil and hydrochar confirming its feasibility as sustainable biofuel source. The present study investigates the effects of solvents, temperature and time on the yield of biocrude oil. The comparatively higher yield of biocrude oil (47 wt%) obtained in methanol-water mass ratio of 0.75:0.25 also contained higher amount of ester components resulting in higher biocrude oil quality. Methanol-water co-solvent favored higher biocrude oil yield with lower nitrogen and oxygen contents as compared to pure water. Response surface methodology was applied to study the effects of temperature (222–322 °C), and reaction time (10–60min) at constant pressure of 11.5 MPa for methanol-water and biomass-solvent ratios of 0.75:0.25 and 1:5, respectively. The optimum yield of biocrude oil (57.8 wt%) and highest energy recovery (85.3%) was obtained with 75 wt% of methanol in water at 272 °C and reaction time of 35 min. Subcritical condition (temperature of 222 °C, pressure of 11.5 MPa) resulted in the highest hydrochar yield (19.5 wt%). Hydrochars were also characterized by CHNS, BET, FT-IR and TGA techniques to ascertain their prospective elemental composition, textural properties, functional groups as well as thermal stability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study focused on producing high quality and yield of biodiesel from novel non-edible seed oil of abundantly available wild Raphnus raphanistrum L. using an efficient, recyclable and eco-friendly copper modified montmorillonite (MMT) clay catalyst. The maximum biodiesel yield of 83% was obtained by base catalyzed transesterification process under optimum operating conditions of methanol to oil ratio of 15:1, reaction temperature of 150 °C, reaction time of 5 h and catalyst loading of 3.5%. The synthesized catalyst and biodiesel were characterized for their structural features and chemical compositions using various state-of-the-art techniques, including x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (1H, 13C) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The fuel properties of the biodiesel were estimated including kinematic viscosity (4.36 cSt), density (0.8312 kg/L), flash point (72 °C), acid value (0.172 mgKOH/g) and sulphur content (0.0002 wt.%). These properties were compared and found in good agreement with the International Biodiesel Standards of American (ASTM-951, 6751), European Committee (EN-14214) and China GB/T 20828 (2007). The catalyst was re-used in five consecutive transesterification reactions without losing much catalytic efficiency. Overall, non-edible Raphnus raphanistrum L. seed oil and Cu doped MMT clay catalyst appeared to be highly active, stable, and cheap contenders for future biofuel industry. However, detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of Raphnus raphanistrum L. seed oil biodiesel are highly recommended to assess the technical, ecological, social and economic challenges. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Co-pyrolysis of rice straw (RS) and ulva prolifera macroalgae (UPM) was studied over a series of nickel-iron-layered double oxides (NiFe-LDO) supported on activated bio-char catalysts. Results showed that, co-pyrolysis produced higher bio-oil yield compared to the individual pyrolysis. Maximum bio-oil yield (46.68 wt%). was found with RS/A-UPM mixture biomass at 500 °C. While RS and UPM and it mixture (RS/UPM) without acid treated UPM was showed lower bio-oil yield. The catalytic pyrolysis up-gradation decreased the bio-oil due to the coke formation. However the bio-oil quality significantly improved with using the 5%Ga/NiFe-LDO/AC catalyst. Also, improved performance with higher amount of bio-oil and lower amounts of char and gas were achieved by acid washing the macroalgae, which is due the removal of ash content or partially fragmented the macromolecule compositions. Catalytic co-pyrolysis of feedstocks also revealed that introducing NiFe-LDO nanosheets into the activated char could result in NiFe-LDO/AC catalysts of higher surface area and increased active sites to adsorb oxygenated and nitrogenated compounds. Being impregnated by 5%Ga, catalysts with improved acid sites and thereby, advanced deoxygenation and aromatization activities were achieved. This implied that the synthesized Ga/NiFe-LDO/AC could be considered as a promising catalyst for RS/A-UPM bio-oil upgrading. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the recent decade, concerns over CO2 emitted by internal combustion engines is the driven force behind stringent emission legislations. Stratified lean-burn strategy in spark-ignition engines is effective in improving fuel economy by reducing pumping loss and heat loss. In this study, two biofuel candidates, 2-methylfuran (MF) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), were tested in this combustion mode in comparison with ethanol and gasoline. All experiments were conducted at an engine speed of 1200 rpm and a load of 5.8 bar indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) with a fixed spark timing of 25° before top dead centre (BTDC). Engine performance and engine emissions of the stratified lean-burn mode (λ (air/fuel ratio) = 1.2 and 1.5) were studied and compared to that of the homogenous mode (λ = 1). The impact of the second injection timing was examined. Results show that the employment of the stratified lean-burn mode could improve the fuel economy by up to 16% if the second injection timing is optimized. The second injection timing also has significant impacts on the IMEP, combustion duration, coefficient of variation (COV), gaseous emission and particulate number (PN) emissions. Generally, combustion duration increases under stratified lean-burn mode, but it decreases if the second injection timing is very late. The COVs for lean-burn mode under a λ of 1.2 are always below 1.5%. However, under the λ of 1.5, COVs significantly increase to 10% when the second injection timing is too early. With the increase of the excess air, the PN concentration significantly reduces by up to 88% for MF, DMF and gasoline under the stratified lean-burn mode. The reduction of the PN is mainly due to the significant reduction of the small particles (&lt;50 nm). However, for ethanol, the reduction of the total PN is not as significant as the other two fuels due to its physiochemical properties. © 2020

AB  - The increase in biodiesel production is leading to a scenario in which more glycerol, which is a by-product of this biofuel production, is generated each day. Among the many potential applications for this substance, steam reforming is emerging as an alternative for solving the glycerol utilization problem, while also providing a new and potentially green source of fuel. In this study, an exergoenvironmental analysis of this process for high-purity hydrogen production was carried out based on data obtained from an Aspen HYSYS® V11 process simulation. Three different scenarios regarding reform gas processing were evaluated from both technical and environmental points of view. Despite the high concentration of water and CO2 in the residual gas obtained after H2 purification, recycling this flow was found to maximize glycerol reforming capacity, while also increasing the system's overall exergy efficiency. For all of the scenarios evaluated through exergy analysis, the environmental impact associated to hydrogen production through glycerol steam reforming was found to be lower than the values reported for methane, indicating that this by-product may be a suitable feedstock for decreasing the environmental impact caused by the use of fossil fuels for hydrogen production. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Biohydrogen production in Microbial Electrolysis Cell (MEC) had inspired the researchers to overcome the challenges associated towards sustainability. Despite microbial community and various substrates, economical cathode catalyst development is most significant factor for enhancing hydrogen production in the MEC. Hence, in this study, the performance of MEC was investigated with a sugar industry effluent (COD 4200 ± 20 mg/L) with graphite anode and modified Nickel foam (NF) cathode. Nickel molybdate (NiMoO4) coated NF achieved a higher hydrogen production rate 0.12 ± 0.01 L.L−1D−1 as compared to control under favorable conditions. Electrochemical characterizations demonstrated that the improved catalytic activity of novel nanocatalyst with lower impedance favoring faster hydrogen evolution kinetics. The MEC with the novel catalyst performed with 58.2% coloumbic efficiency, 20.36% cathodic hydrogen recovery, 11.96% overall hydrogen recovery and 54.38% COD removal efficiency for a 250 mL substrate during 5 days’ batch cycle. Hence, the potentiality of modified cathode was established with the real time industrial effluent highlighting the waste to wealth bio-electrochemical technology. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Research on the production of bio-hydrogenated diesel as a green second-generation biodiesel is increasingly attractive for renewable energy utilization in engines, and has potentially been produced from the hydrotreating of vegetable oils. The present work investigated the hydrodeoxygenation of palm oil catalyzed by unsupported nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) sulfide synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The effects of the operating parameters, such as the reaction time (0.5–3 h), temperature (280–320 °C), oil concentration (5–15%) on the n-alkane yield were evaluated. A longer reaction time and higher temperature promoted the reaction via decarboxylation and decarbonylation pathways. Under the appropriate condition (300 °C, 2 h, and initial H2 pressure of 30 bar), the yield of C14–18 alkanes was 75.3 wt%, while the selectivity of n-C15, n-C16, n-C17, and n-C18 alkanes was 21.8, 19.7, 29.6, and 28.1%, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed n-alkenes, alcohols, and esters as byproducts. Characterization of catalyst revealed it had a sandwich structure consisting of weakly coupled layers, rim sites and Ni edges, which catalyzed the reaction efficiently. The catalyst could be reused for at least four cycles of palm oil hydrodeoxygenation with retention of a good performance with the decreased 17–25% alkane yield (2nd to 4th cycle with 50.8–57.3% n-C14–18 yield). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this work was to study the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of Prosopis juliflora biomass for the production of ferulic acid and bio-oil. Biomass was processed with various solvents (NaOH, KOH, HCl and H2SO4) to produce ferulic acid (FA). FA oxidation was carried out using the Nano ZnO catalyst to produce an optimum vanillin yield of 0.3 g at 70 °C with 0.4% catalyst loading for a time of 60 min. The spent solid residue was then processed using HTL at 5 MPa pressure and a temperature range of 240–340 °C. Various biomass loading (2.5 g to 12.5 g) was taken for a fixed water content of 200 mL. Bio-oil optimum yield was 22.5 wt% for 10 g/200 mL of biomass loading ratio. The optimum temperature was 300 °C for a processing time of 1 h. The catalyst showed the reusable capability of two three consecutive cycles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, the algal biomass productivity and its lipid content were explored using a database containing 4670 instances extracted from the experimental results reported in 102 published articles. First, the influences of critical factors such as microalgae species, cultivation conditions, light intensity, CO2 amount, nutrient concentrations, reactor type, stress conditions, cell disruption methods, and lipid extraction solvents on the biomass and lipid production were reviewed. Then, the database was analyzed using machine learning techniques; decision trees were utilized to determine the combination of variables leading to high biomass and lipid content while association rule mining was used to find the specific conditions leading to very high biomass and lipid levels. Decision tree analysis discovered 11 different combinations of variables leading to high biomass productivity and 13 combinations for high lipid content; whereas, association rule mining analysis helped to identify the levels of specific factors for very high biomass and lipid production. It was then concluded that machine learning methods can help to determine the best conditions for optimum biomass growth and lipid yield for microalgae to manufacture renewable biofuels, and this can guide the planning of new experimental works. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of OH-impregnated CaO as heterogeneous catalyst in the conversion of refined coconut oil into crude biodiesel was investigated in this study. Wet impregnation method was used to study the effects of NaOH concentration (10–20% (w/v) solution), calcination temperature (550 °C–700 °C), and calcination time (2–5.5 h). Characterization of the OH-impregnated CaO catalyst was done using XRD, FTIR, and SEM. Conversion of refined coconut oil into biodiesel was performed via transesterification with methanol at 60 °C using OH-impregnated CaO as catalyst. Results show that a 66.36% conversion to biodiesel can be achieved in 10 min when 20% (w/v) NaOH solution was used during impregnation with calcination at 600 °C for 2 h. Addition of tetrahydrofuran as cosolvent increased the conversion further to 81.70% which is comparable to the 85.98% achieved when using NaOH as a catalyst under the same reaction conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this work is to develop a magnetically recoverable magnesium substituted zinc ferrite nanocatalysts for production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil. Microwave assisted combustion process were employed to synthesis the nanocatalyst. The catalyst were characterized by XRD, FTIR, HR-SEM, EDX, DRS and VSM analysis. The VSM study revealed a relatively high magnetic moment and high saturation magnetization property useful for magnetic separation of the catalyst from the reaction medium. Biodiesel conversion of 99.9% was achieved at the optimized reaction conditions like 3 wt% of Mg2+ doped ZnFe2O4 nanocatalyst (ZnMgF5 sample), reaction temperature about 65ᵒC, methanol-oil molar ratio of 18:1 and reaction time 30 min. Investigation on the transesterification kinetics using ZnMgF5 revealed the rate constants ranging from 0.0375 min−1 to 0.2382 min−1, activation energy Eg = 52 kJ mol−1 and frequency factor A = 2.31 × 107 min−1. The negative values of entropy (ΔS°) indicates, increased randomness of the system. Thermodynamic parameters ΔG° = 87.17 kJ mol−1 at 338 K and ΔH° = 49.31 kJ mol−1 indicate that the transesterification reaction is non-spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The magnetically separated catalyst retained 94% of biodiesel yield even after ten cycles of recovery showing a very good performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work is focused on the production, emission and performance characteristics at variable compression ratios (CRs) on a compression ignition multi-fuel engine using Argemone Mexicana oil methyl ester and its blends with diesel (on a quantity basis) was observed and compared with the same. The feasibility of employing Argemone Mexicana oil methyl ester as a biofuel has been determined in the present work. Experiments have been conducted at a constant engine speed of 1,500 rpm and results are obtained at different CR of 14:1, 15:1, 16:1, 17:1, and 18:1. The ratios of blends used in this experiment are D100, AME5, AME10, AME20, AME35, AME50 and AME100, where the values relate to the share of the type of fuel given by the characters. The significance of compression ratio on the engine performance and emission has been investigated and presented for all the blends of biodiesel. The optimum results are obtained AME20 at CR17, which shows that the values of brake thermal efficiency, brake power, and specific fuel consumption are superior to that of both diesel and other blends. These blends, as fuel produces less emissions of CO, HC and marginally increase in NOx compared to that of diesel.

AB  - The utilization of renewable lignocellulosic biomasses for bioenergy synthesis is believed to facilitate competitive commercialization and realize affordable clean energy sources in the future. Among the pathways for biomass pretreatment methods that enhance the efficiency of the whole biofuel production process, the combined microwave irradiation and physicochemical approach is found to provide many economic and environmental benefits. Several studies on microwave-based pretreatment technologies for biomass conversion have been conducted in recent years. Although some reviews are available, most did not comprehensively analyze microwave–physicochemical pretreatment techniques for biomass conversion. The study of these techniques is crucial for sustainable biofuel generation. Therefore, the biomass pretreatment process that combines the physicochemical method with microwave-assisted irradiation is reviewed in this paper. The effects of this pretreatment process on lignocellulosic structure and the ratio of achieved components were also discussed in detail. Pretreatment processes for biomass conversion were substantially affected by temperature, irradiation time, initial feedstock components, catalyst loading, and microwave power. Consequently, neoteric technologies utilizing high efficiency-based green and sustainable solutions should receive further focus. In addition, methodologies for quantifying and evaluating effects and relevant trade-offs should be develop to facilitate the take-off of the biofuel industry with clean and sustainable goals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel will provide a significant renewable energy source for transportation in the near future. In the present study, principal component analysis (PCA) has been used to understand the relationship between important properties of biodiesel and its chemical composition. Finally, several artificial intelligence-based models were developed to predict specific biodiesel properties based on their chemical composition. The experimental study was conducted in order to generate training data for the artificial neural network (ANN). Available (experimental) data from the literature was also employed for this modeling strategy. The analytical part of this study found a complex multi-dimensional correlation between chemical composition and biodiesel properties. Average numbers of double bonds in the chemical structure (representing the unsaturated component in biodiesel) and the poly-unsaturated component in biodiesel had a great impact on biodiesel properties. The simulation result in this study demonstrated that ANN is a useful tool for investigating the fuel properties from its chemical composition which eventually can replace the time consuming and costly experimental test. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A huge amount of a mixture of unreacted fatty acids and mono/di/triglycerides, namely bio-heavy oil, is generated as a waste from biodiesel industry. Considering that the lipid (i.e., triglycerides) accounts for 80% of the total biodiesel production cost, valorization of bio-heavy oil into biodiesel can be a viable route for enhancing the economic/environmental benefits. Nonetheless, the high contents of free fatty acids and impurities have restricted practical valorization of bio-heavy oil into biodiesel because conventional acid/base catalyzed transesterification suffers from the presence of the impurities. To overcome the technical challenge, this study suggested a direct valorization platform for the conversion of bio-heavy oil into biodiesel via thermally induced transesterification. Prior to biodiesel production, the properties of bio-heavy oil, such as acid value (105 mg KOH g−1 bio-heavy oil), its elemental compositions and thermal stability were characterized. Acid-catalyzed transesterification with a H2SO4 catalyst showed the 31.1 wt% of biodiesel yield after 24 h of reaction at 60 °C. However, thermally induced transesterification exhibited 59.3 wt% of biodiesel yield after 1 min of reaction at 400 °C using a porous medium (SiO2) with no presence of a catalyst. The porous SiO2 (pore size: 6 nm) provided confined spaces for lipids and methanol, allowing the rapid transesterification reactions between them at high temperature. The biodiesel yield from thermally induced transesterification was proportionate to reaction temperature by 360 °C, but it decreased at &gt; 400 °C due to the chemical bond scissions of unsaturated hydrocarbons. C6-22 fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were produced from thermally induced (non-catalytic) transesterifications, and weight fractions of each FAMEs were constant, regardless of the reaction conditions at ≤ 400 °C. All experimental findings offer a new recycle platform for BHO into biodiesel. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Improving biomass enzymatic saccharification is effective for crop straw utilization, whereas phytoremediation is efficient for trace metal elimination from polluted agricultural soil. Here, we found that the green proteins extracted from Amaranthus leaf tissue could act as active biosurfactant to remarkably enhance lignocellulose enzymatic saccharification for high bioethanol production examined in eight grassy and woody plants after mild chemical and green-like pretreatments were performed. Notably, this study estimated that total green proteins supply collected from one-hectare-land Amaranth plants could even lead to additional 6400–12,400 tons of bioethanol, being over 10-fold bioethanol yield higher than those of soybean seed proteins and chemical surfactant. Meanwhile, the Amaranth green proteins were characterized as a dominated biosorbent for multiple trace metals (Cd, Pb, As) adsorption, being 2.9–6 folds higher than those of its lignocellulose. The Amaranth plants were also assessed to accumulate much more trace metals than all other plants as previously examined from large-scale contaminated soils. Furthermore, the Amaranth green proteins not only effectively block lignin to release active cellulases for the mostly enhanced biomass hydrolyzes, but also efficiently involve in multiple chemical bindings with Cd, which should thus address critical issues of high-costly biomass waste utilization and low-efficient trace metal remediation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, a new recyclable TiO2-decorated magnetic ZIF-8 (Fe3O4@ZIF-8/TiO2) nanocomposite catalyst was first synthesized and its structural and morphological properties were characterized through different techniques such as XRD, FT-IR, TEM, EDX, TPD, and VSM. Then, biodiesel was produced using the Fe3O4@ZIF-8/TiO2 catalyst through the esterification of oleic acid in the presence of ethanol. Response surface methodology (RSM) was also employed to achieve the optimum experimental operating variables affecting the yield of biodiesel production. Significant variables like the amount of catalyst, the molar ratio of alcohol to fatty acid, reaction time, and temperature were optimized through RSM to achieve the highest yield of biodeisel production. The results indicated that the highest biodiesel yield is obtained at the reaction temperature of 50 °C, the reaction time of 62.5 min, the alcohol to oleic acid molar ratio 30:1, and 0.2 g (6 %wt) amount of catalyst. In this condition, the highest yield of biodiesel production was found 80% and 93% using ethanol and methanol, respectively; around 40% higher than pristine TiO2 and magnetic ZIF-8. Subsequently, the biodiesel production in optimum conditions was evaluated from frying oil by using the as-prepared catalyst. The result from 1H NMR and GC–MS analyses confirmed the efficient conversion of frying oil wastes to valuable biofuel product. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass feedstocks offer very promising sustainable production of fuels and chemicals as fossil fuels generate greenhouse gases and are going to become scarce. Nevertheless, establishing value addition to biomass waste to produce commodity chemicals by combining economic and environmental performances is complex. In this context, hydrogenation of biomass based levulinic acid at normal atmospheric reaction conditions using robust cobalt supported on porous heterogeneous catalyst has been studied at 200 °C in a continuous process. The systematic investigation of Lewis acidic sites and low reaction temperature contribute to achieve 99 % conversion of levulinic acid and 80 % selectivity of γ-valerolactone. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel production calls for innovative solutions to turn into a competitive process with a reduced environmental impact. One of the process bottlenecks stands in the immiscibility of oil and alcohol as raw materials, so mixing process largely impacts the overall process cost. This process step, if carried out by using hydrodynamic cavitation, has the possibility to become a benchmark for large scale applications. In this paper a process analysis of biodiesel production scheme is developed starting from two different feedstocks, virgin oil and waste cooking oil. At the first the traditional process scheme has been simulated, in a second simulation, the reactor for the biodiesel production is interchanged with a hydrodynamic cavitation reactor. In the paper, the comparison between the traditional and innovative process by using life cycle costing approach has been presented, thus providing indications for industrial technological implementation coming from a professional tool for process analysis. It is worth noting that the introduction of hydrodynamic cavitation reduces of about 40% the energy consumption with respect to the traditional process. As regards the total treatment costs, when using virgin oil as feedstock, they were in the range 820–830 €/t (innovative and traditional process, respectively); while starting from waste cooking oil the costs decreased of about 60%, down to 290–300 €/t (innovative and traditional process, respectively). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The rapid depletion of fossil fuel resources and climatic changes has triggered the researchers' attention to find an alternative and renewable energy source. Thus, biodiesel has been recognized as a potential alternative to petrodiesel for its biodegradability, non-toxicity, and environment-friendly attributes. In this study, an efficient and recyclable Cu–Ni doped ZrO2 catalyst was synthesized and used to produce biodiesel from a novel non-edible caper (Capparis spinosa L.) seed oil. The synthesized catalyst was characterized by x-ray diffraction, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. The catalyst was reused in four consecutive transesterification reactions without losing any significant catalytic efficiency. Transesterification reaction conditions were optimized via response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken design for predicting optimum biodiesel yields by drawing 3D surface plots. Maximum biodiesel yield of 90.2% was obtained under optimal operating conditions of 1:6 M ratio of oil to methanol, reaction temperature of 70 °C, reaction time of 1.5 h, and 2.5% catalyst loading. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H and 13C) analysis confirmed the high quality of biodiesel produced from non-edible caper (Capparis spinosa L.) seed oil. The fuel properties of the produced biodiesel were also found, such as kinematic viscosity (4.17 cS T), density (0.8312 kg/L), flash point (72 °C), acid no (0.21 mgKOH/g) and sulphur content (0.00042 wt%). These properties were matched and are in close agreement with the International Biodiesel Standards of European Union (EU-14214), China GB/T 20,828 (2007), and American (ASTM6751). Thus, non-edible Capparis spinosa L. seed oil and Cu–Ni doped ZrO2 catalyst appeared to be highly active, stable, and cheap candidates to boost the future biodiesel industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, carbon-silica based acid catalysts derived from rice husks (RH) were successfully synthesised using microwave (MW) technology. The results showed that MW sulphonation produced Sulphur (S) content of 17.2–18.5 times higher than in raw RH. Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) showed peak at 1035 cm−1 which corresponded to O˭S˭O stretching of sulphonic (-SO3H) group. XRD showed sulfonated RH catalysts (SRHCs) have amorphous structure, and through SEM, broadening of the RH voids and also formation of pores is observed. RH600 had the highest surface area of 14.52 m2/g. SRHCs showed high catalytic activity for esterification of oleic acid with methanol with RH600 had the highest initial formation rate (6.33 mmol L−1 min−1) and yield (97%). The reusability of the catalyst showed gradually dropped yield of product for every recycle, which might be due to leaching of –SO3H. Finally, esterification of oil recovered from palm oil mill effluent (POME) with methanol achieved a conversion of 87.3% free fatty acids (FFA) into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). © 2020

AB  - High molecular weight alcohol and ether fuels with their advanced autoignition propensities and oxygenated molecular structures are promising future fuel candidates for compression-ignition engine application, because they can provide improved combustion efficiencies and reduced pollutant emissions. In addition, their production from lignocellulosic biomass as second-generation biofuels offers an improved CO2 balance and avoids the adverse impact of the first-generation biofuel production on the food supply. This review aims to summarize the recent research progress on the combustion of long-chain alcohols and ethers with more than four carbon atoms, putting a particular emphasis on their fundamental combustion kinetics. The article starts with aspects related to their production routes, physical and chemical properties, and practical applications, highlighting the resulting consequences for their potentials as renewable fuels in comparison with conventional diesel fuels. This is followed by a comprehensive evaluation of their fundamental ignition and combustion characteristics. The existing chemical mechanisms for the oxidation of higher alcohols and ethers are introduced in conjunction with discussions of their development approaches. Their reaction kinetics are further explored to understand the dependence of their combustion behaviors on the molecule's structural features, such as functional groups and carbon chain length. In particular, the different influences of the molecule size on the cetane numbers of longer alcohols and ethers are analyzed. The review finishes with a discussion suggesting directions for future experimental and numerical investigations, which will allow deepening of the understanding of the combustion kinetics of higher alcohol and ether fuels. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Microalgae have been accepted as a potential feedstock for biofuel production due to their high oil content and rapid biomass production. In this study, deoiled Scenedesmus obliquus (SO) was used for evaluating whether deoiled algal biomass residue is potential as an alternative energy resource for bio-ethanol production with different heterogeneous catalysts. The SO biomass was examined for its physiochemical properties and also evaluated using FTIR, XRD, and TGA techniques. The successful hydrolysis of SO was performed employing different eco-friendly bio-based heterogeneous catalysts and hydrolysate thus obtained was then subjected to fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand was analyzed through HPLC and GC which resulted in the production of bio-ethanol with the highest yield of 68.32 % at 8.24 g/L concentration. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Biodiesel production using supercritical methanolysis has received immense interest over the last few years. It has the ability to convert high acid value feedstock into biodiesel using a single-pot reaction. However, the energy intensive process is the main disadvantage of supercritical biodiesel process. Herein, a conceptual design for the integration of supercritical biodiesel process with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is presented to recover residual hot streams and to generate electric power. This article provides energy and techno-economic comparative study for three developed scenarios as follows: original process with no energy integration (Scenario 1), energy integrated process (Scenario 2) and advanced energy integrated process with ORC (Scenario 3). The developed integrated biodiesel process with ORC resulted in electric power generation that has not only satisfied the process electric requirement but also provided excess power of 257 kW for 8,000 tonnes/annum biodiesel plant. The techno-economic comparative analysis resulted in favouring the third scenario with 36% increase in the process profitability than the second scenario. Sensitivity analysis has shown that biodiesel price variation has significant effect on the process profitability. In summary, integrating supercritical biodiesel production process with ORC appears to be a promising approach for enhancing the process techno-economic profitability and viability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass-derived intermediate chemicals, such as furfuryl alcohol (FA) and levulinic acid (LA) are feeds for ethanolysis reaction to produce ethyl levulinate (EL). EL is a promising chemical that can be used as a biofuel additive and precursor for chemical synthesis, such as γ-valerolactone. The present study conducted the ethanolysis of FA and LA using modified carbon cryogel as heterogeneous catalysts for improving the EL yield. The carbon cryogel (UCC) precursor was produced from urea and furfural, and modified via sulfonation. Iron (Fe) doping was then conducted to improve the surface chemistry of the catalyst. The catalytic activity of sulfonated carbon cryogel (UCC-S) was evaluated for LA ethanolysis, and the UCC-S-Fe prepared from the incorporation of Fe on UCC-S was utilised to catalyse FA ethanolysis. The effects of reaction parameters (i.e., time, molar ratio of ethanol to feed, catalyst loading, and reaction temperature) were significant on the catalytic performance. High EL yield of 95.8 mol% and 95.4 mol% were obtained from the ethanolysis of LA and FA, respectively. The performance of ethanolysis of carbohydrates and various biomass samples was evaluated to determine the EL yield using UCC-S-Fe. Both UCC-S and UCC-S-Fe were characterised using FTIR, XRD, TGA, NH3-TPD, BET, and SEM-EDX. The modification of UCC via sulfonation and Fe-doping improved the catalyst properties, and UCC-S-Fe demonstrated the potential to enhance biomass conversion to EL. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

In this study, heavy metal-containing sunflower residues obtained from a phytoremediation site were hydrothermally carbonized at 160–260 °C. The properties of hydrochar thus produced were evaluated with respect to its potential as solid fuel. The results confirmed that hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) reduced the concentration of heavy metals in hydrochars, with the concentration lower than the maximum permissible level of domestic standards for bio-solid refuse fuel. Higher HTC temperatures resulted in improved energy-related properties of the hydrochar (i.e., coalification degree, fuel ratio, and higher heating value); however, HTC temperatures between 200 and 220 °C were deemed suitable for energy retention efficiency. Furthermore, as hydrochar contains low nitrogen and ash content, it can be considered as a clean energy source. The results of this study suggest a sustainable approach to the disposal and effective utilization of contaminant-containing biowastes. Moreover, this study suggests linking biomass cultivation for phytoremediation and converting the phytoremediated biomass into value-added solid fuel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - CaO derived from calcined eggshell was doped with Na–K by wet impregnation method and the effect of different Na/K molar ratios was investigated on biodiesel production from canola oil. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), and Thermogravimetric (TGA) analyses. FAME yields were determined by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The Na–K/CaO catalyst with Na/K molar ratio of 1 showed the highest FAME yield of 97.6% at optimum reaction conditions. Structural investigation of materials revealed that FAME yield was proportional to the number of basic sites on the surface of catalyst. The optimum reaction conditions were found to be catalyst loading of 3 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio of 9:1, reaction temperature of 50 °C, and reaction time of 3 h. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a fuel comprised of mono-alkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel is designated B100 and is regarded as the major substitute for fossil diesel. Crambe abyssinica, a native plant from Ethiopia, has great potential for biodiesel production due to its higher calorific value and oxidative stability as compared to soybean oil biodiesel. Compared to fossil diesel, C. abyssinica oil biodiesel emits significantly less CO2 without efficiency loss. However, its crude oil only provides good results if it undergoes supercritical transesterification. Here, we aimed to produce ethyl and methyl esters from crambe oil under ambient conditions. Initially, we tested two methods to degum crambe oil: aqueous degumming and acid degumming. We subjected the degummed oil to transesterification through the methylic or the ethylic route, catalyzed by KOH. The methyl esters of the biodiesel obtained by esterification of crambe oil submitted to acid degumming had higher oxidative stability as compared to the methyl esters of the biodiesel obtained from crambe oil subjected to aqueous degumming: 15.7 h and 10.7 h, respectively, but the yield was lower: 70% vs. 80%, respectively. The ethyl esters of the biodiesel obtained from crambe oil submitted to aqueous degumming provided the highest yield and oxidative stability: 65% and 8.5 h, respectively. We also evaluated the oxidative stability of blends consisting of crambe oil methylic or ethylic biodiesel and soybean oil biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper reports the results obtained for microwave-assisted catalytic fast pyrolysis (MACFP) of rice husk. The MACFP process employed a hierarchical catalyst prepared via a combination of organic alkali treatment (TPAOH) and the generation of an external layer of MCM-41-type mesoporous channels. We propose this catalyst which is used for the first time for pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, as a tool to reduce coke agglomeration and increase hydrocarbon yields. Our results indicate that during catalyst preparation the mass fraction of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) has a direct effect on the content of MCM-41 formed on top of the HZSM-5 core. For MACFP, we hypothesize that the small molecules generated from thermal decomposition of rice husk react further to form aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons by decarbonylation, decarboxylation, oligomerization and aromatization. The highest hydrocarbon yield (60.5%) was obtained for a catalyst modified by a 2.0 mol/L TPAOH solution, with 10 wt% of CTAB (template for producing MCM-41), as well as with digestion and crystallization at 110 °C for 24 h. In addition, the highest liquid yield (47.6 wt%) was obtained at 550 °C. The relative content of hydrocarbons goes through a maximum of 60.5% with CTAB mass fraction which was higher than values obtained with MCM-41 (3.2%) and HZSM-5 (36.0%). Characterization and catalytic testing results suggest that the digestion temperature plays a more important role in the catalyst synthesis than the crystallization temperature. High digestion temperature (120 °C) decreases the overall hydrocarbon selectivity from 60.5% (110 °C) to 39.2%. The relative content of oxygenates reached the lowest value of 35.9% at the digestion and crystallization temperature of 110 °C. The synergistic effect of the MCM-41 shell and the HZSM-5 core promotes the catalytic activity, leading to outstanding deoxygenation capabilities and excellent selectivity to BTEX (52.7%). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to investigate the optimum transesterification method for the production of biodiesel from microalgae. Chlorococcum sp. and Scenedesmus sp. cultivated in secondary treated municipal wastewater and in 1/3N BG-11 medium, respectively, were selected for the conversion of their lipids by one- and two-step transesterification processes. Sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide catalysts were separately employed in one-step transesterification process, and a two-stage process employing the basic catalyst followed by the acidic one in the second step was also used. The quality of the produced biodiesel was strongly determined by the catalyst used. The analysis of fatty acid methyl esters of the Chlorococcum sp. lipids showed that the two-step process has similar effects compared with one-step with acid (21.56 and 21.85 mg of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), respectively). On the other hand, better results were obtained through the two-step process with the Scenedesmus sp. (40.51 mg of FAMEs), compared with one-step methods with acid and base catalysts (9.57 and 22.3 mg of FAMEs, respectively). The type of methyl esters produced is strongly depended on the type of algal species and growth conditions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted great shocks and challenges to the environment, society and economy. Simultaneously, an intractable issue appeared: a considerable number of hazardous medical wastes have been generated from the hospitals, clinics, and other health care facilities, constituting a serious threat to public health and environmental sustainability without proper management. Traditional disposal methods like incineration, landfill and autoclaving are unable to reduce environmental burden due to the issues such as toxic gas release, large land occupation, and unsustainability. While the application of clean and safe pyrolysis technology on the medical wastes treatment to produce high-grade bioproducts has the potential to alleviate the situation. Besides, medical wastes are excellent and ideal raw materials, which possess high hydrogen, carbon content and heating value. Consequently, pyrolysis of medical wastes can deal with wastes and generate valuable products like bio-oil and biochar. Consequently, this paper presents a critical and comprehensive review of the pyrolysis of medical wastes. It demonstrates the feasibility of pyrolysis, which mainly includes pyrolysis characteristics, product properties, related problems, the prospects and future challenges of pyrolysis of medical wastes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, medical wastes were often mixed with municipal solid waste and disposed of in waste landfills or improper treatment facilities. Many reviews have been devoted to the pyrolysis of plastics and other solid wastes. However, a review on the pyrolysis potential of medical wastes has not been reported previously, prompting its publication during this pandemic. Pyrolysis of medical wastes can deal with wastes and generate valuable products like bio-oil and biochar. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research investigation, three microalgal species were screened (Pleurosigma sp., Amphora sp., and Amphiprora sp.) for lipid content before choosing the potential microalgae for biodiesel production. It was found that the lipid content of Amphiprora sp. was 41.48 ± 0.18%, which was higher than the Pleurosigma sp. (27.3 ± 0.8%) and Amphora sp. (22.49 ± 0.21%). The diatom microalga, Amphiprora sp. was isolated and exposed to a controlled environment. Two different media were prepared, and the main research was on the SiO2-NP medium as the cell wall of diatom was made up of silica. Essential growth parameters were studied such as dry cell weight and chlorophyll a content. The results revealed that Amphiprora sp. cultured in the modified medium showed a higher biomass yield and growth rate in all the analyses. In Soxhlet extraction method, biodiesel yield of Amphiprora sp. in modified medium under 24 μmol m−2 s−1 of light intensity was 81.47 ± 1.59% when using 2% of catalyst amount with 1.5:1 volume ratio of methanol/oil in 3 h reaction time at 65 °C. Results reveled that Amphiprora sp. diatom has a higher yield of oil 52.94 ± 0.42% and can be efficiently optimized with further studies with modified nanomaterial culture medium. The present research revealed the series of experiments on microalgal lipid transesterification and in future investigation different types of nanomaterials should be used in culture medium to identify the lipid production in microalgal cells. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A new heterogeneous biochar/CaO/K2CO3 catalyst was fabricated to produce biodiesel from waste edible oil. In this catalyst, the biochar was produced from brown algae of Sargassum oligocystum and CaO from eggshells. The XRD result showed that the biochar, CaO, and synthesized catalyst have a crystalline structure. Response surface methodology-central composite design (RSM-CCD) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were used to investigate the effect of parameters and determine optimal conditions. Also, the maximum efficiency of biodiesel production (98.83%) was predicted by the RSM-CCD method at 65 °C, 4 wt% catalyst content, 200 min duration, and 18: 1 methanol to oil ratio. The process of biodiesel production was exothermic. The activation energy and frequency factor were calculated 45.53 kJ/mol and 6.03 × 10+4 min−1, respectively. Biodiesel properties were evaluated according to international standards (ASTM D6751 and EN14214). The catalyst was reused for up to 90% efficiency in up to 5 steps. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The new European directive for the promotion of renewable energy mandates an increase in the share of advanced and waste-based biofuels in the transport sector. In this study, an advanced glycerol-derived biofuel was used as a component of a ternary blend, denoted as o·bio®. This blend included 27.4 %v/v of fatty acid glycerol formal ester, 69.6 %v/v of fatty acid methyl ester and 3 %v/v of acetals obtained as a by-product of the fatty acid glycerol formal ester production process (which were proved to improve cold-flow properties). Finally, o·bio® was blended with diesel fuel at a content of 20 %v/v. Two operating conditions based on usual driving modes were selected, where the engine calibration could be re-optimized after the change of fuel, corresponding to vehicle velocities of 50 and 70 km/h. Since the main effect of the blend used is to reduce particulate matter emissions, exhaust gas recirculation was increased and injection was delayed, so that the initial benefits in particulate matter emissions could be re-distributed into benefits in both particulate matter and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. From a combined analysis of the particulate matter–NOx trade-off and trying to limit the negative effect of delaying injection on fuel consumption, the final proposal was to set an additional 6% exhaust gas recirculation at 50 km/h and an additional 3% exhaust gas recirculation at 70 km/h, while delaying injection 2 °CA after top dead center at both vehicle operating conditions with respect to the original calibration. The use of the blend along with the optimization of the engine calibration is expected to reduce particulate matter and NOx emissions by around 50% with a vehicle speed condition of 50 km/h and to reduce particulate matter and NOx emissions by around 30% and 40% at 70 km/h with respect to diesel fuel emissions. © IMechE 2019.

AB  - The growing anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions combined with the rise of the demand on energy resources has expedited research into sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel. In this context, biomass has increased in popularity and acquired a significant share of the global energy mix in a relatively short time. However, several biomass resources have triggered wide criticism for compromising food resources, agricultural lands and fresh water to produce energy crops. Therefore, a second generation of non-edible biomass such as Jatropha curcas has become a major biofuel feedstock for several countries. Not only can its oil be converted into liquid fuels, but also the Jatropha fruit residues have high calorific value and are processed into several forms of energy. Several studies have investigated the different processing technologies to produce energy and food-related products, although no conclusions have been made on the most sustainable pathway for Jatropha utilisation considering its interlinkages to the energy, water and food resources, whilst considering its possible contributions to mitigating carbon emissions and the development of circular economies. As such, this study investigates 11 processing pathways for the major three components of Jatropha fruit from cradle to gate via a combination of three key tools including Energy-Water-Food (EWF) Nexus, Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Return on Investment (ROI). Aspen Plus software is used to simulate the production processes including transesterification, hydrotreatment, hydrocracking, gasification, pyrolysis, hydrothermal liquefaction, anaerobic digestion, saccharification and fermentation, incineration and detoxification. In addition, a mathematical model is developed to run a five-objective optimisation study using MATLAB. The model identifies an opportunity to process the Jatropha oil by transesterification (49%), hydrotreatment (28%) and hydrocracking (23%). while it is suggested that the seedcake is best utilised directly as fertilisers (35%) and processed for energy production by pyrolysis (30%) and anaerobic digestion (17%). Nevertheless, the shells of Jatropha are best utilised via SSF (32%), pyrolysis (28%), anaerobic digestion (22%) and incineration (11%). © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The generation of sulfur-containing pollution products affects the quality of biofuels obtained from the supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of sludge. This study investigates the effects of the gasification temperature, moisture content, and reaction atmosphere on the evolution of sulfur-containing compounds. The results showed that temperature was the key parameter causing the migration of sulfur from sludge to biogas and liquid products. The sludge decomposition reaction was dominated by ionic reactions at 360 °C, while the decomposition of organic matter was converted to free radical reactions as the temperature increased from 380 °C to 440 °C. The mercaptan and thioether contents of the bio-oil decreased to 0.3% at 440 °C. Correspondingly, the concentration of H2S increased from 6.7 ppm to 38.0 ppm. The decomposition of organic sulfur with an unstable structure (S-H bond and S-C bond) was the main cause of the increase in the content of H2S. Additionally, the solubility and oxidation properties of supercritical water were extremely strong. Some sulfur-containing organic compounds were converted into SO42- via hydrolysis and oxidation reactions, forming sulfate crystals with heavy metals in the bio-char, which aided in achieving the synergistic immobilization of sulfur and heavy metals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Reduction of CO2 to acetate in microbial electrosynthesis has been widely studied. However, the selective and quantitative production of longer chain chemicals and biofuels is still a bottleneck. Lack of sufficient energy provided by only the cathode electrode in Bio-electrochemical systems during chain elongation is one of the key challenges. It is assumed that additional electron donors than a polarised cathode is required to steer the production towards longer chain of carboxylates than acetate. In this study, formate and ethanol were supplied separately in the reactors fed by CO2 for 45 days in addition to the cathodes poised at −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl to investigate their effect on production. Although acetate was still the major product, supplying electron donors directed the production towards more diverse and longer chain organic chemicals than that in presence of the polarised cathode only. Significant improvement in the production of butyrate (×3.8 increase in maximum concentration) and butanol (maximum of 6.8 ± 0.3 mmol C L−1) was observed after supplying formate, while ethanol increased the diversity of the products. Supplying formate and ethanol in reactors for another 30 days under open circuit potential clarified that only ethanol could provide sufficient energy for butyrate production from acetate in the absence of polarised cathode, which reached the highest butyrate concentration of 19.1 ± 2.3 mmol C L−1. Formate was only consumed in presence of polarised cathode. It is proposed in our study that production of C4 products in presence of only cathodic electrode or cathodic electrode and formate could be associated to initial reduction of acetate to ethanol, consumed for production of C4 products through acetate. Trace levels of caproate and hexanol were detected in both reactors supplied with formate and ethanol only in the presence of polarised cathode. © 2020

AB  - In order to reduce the fossil fuel usage, to meet huge energy demand and lessen air pollution, a green, clean and sustainable biofuel is the only alternative. Biodiesel production becomes cheaper when we use a cheap precursor, eco-friendly catalyst and a proper process. Pig tallow from the meat industry containing high fatty acid can be utilized as an effective precursor for biodiesel preparation. This study produced biodiesel from pig tallow oil via ultrasonic assisted and CuO catalysed two-step esterification process. Cinnamomum tamala (C. tamala) extract was utilized for CuO nanoparticles preparation and characterized using infra-red spectra, x-ray diffraction, particle size distribution, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Biodiesel production was modelled using Box-Behnken design (BBD) and artificial neural network (ANN), in the variables range of ultrasonication (US) time (20–40 min), CuO nanocatalyst load (1–3 wt%), and the methanol to pre-treated PTO molar ratio (10:1–30:1). Statistical analysis proved that the ANN modelling was better than BBD. Optimal yield of 97.82% obtained using Genetic Algorithm (GA) at US time: 35.36 min, CuO catalyst load: 2.07 wt%, and the molar ratio: 29.87:1. Comparison with previous studies proved that ultrasonication significantly reduced the CuO nanocatalyst load, and increased the molar ratio and improved the process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For the first time, this work addresses the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignocellulosic bio-oil over a carbon–neutral Mo2C/CNF catalyst for the production of liquid biofuels and value-added chemicals, thoroughly examining the effect of the temperature, initial H2 pressure, reaction time and catalyst/bio-oil ratio. These variables had a significant influence on the process, allowing the transformation of the original bio-oil into different fractions in varying yields, including an upgraded bio-oil (17–72%), a solid product (4–44%), an aqueous phase (5–39%) and a gaseous stream (1–15%). The upgraded bio-oil comprised a mix of phenols (56–78%), cyclic ketones (7–30%), carboxylic acids (2–8%), esters (0–9%) and aromatic compounds (0–20%). The relative amounts of C, H and O of this product shifted by 34–78 wt%, 3–8 wt% and 13–62 wt%, while its HHV ranged between 9 and 35 MJ/kg. Process optimisation revealed that using a temperature of 350 °C, an initial H2 pressure of 40 bar and 0.19 g cat/g bio-oil for 1 h, it was possible to convert 65% of the organic content of the bio-oil into a liquid bio-fuel with a HHV of 30 MJ/kg (twice the value of the original feedstock), which represents a deoxygenation degree of 70% and an energy efficiency of 62%. Besides, all the bio-oil organic content can be converted into a liquid product with a high proportion of phenols (79%) at 250 °C, applying an initial H2 pressure of 20 bar and 0.14 g cat/g bio-oil for around 0.5 h. This liquid can be used as a sustainable phenolic-rich antioxidant additive as well as a bio-based source of aromatic compounds. Therefore, these results are a step forward in the biomass conversion over carbon–neutral catalysts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The huge amount of agro-wastes generated due to expanding agricultural activities can potentially cause serious environmental and human health problems. Using the biorefinery concept, all parts of agricultural plants can be converted into multiple value-added bioproducts while reducing waste generation. This approach can be viewed as an effective strategy in developing and realizing a circular bioeconomy by accomplishing the dual goals of waste mitigation and energy recovery. However, the sustainability issue of biorefineries should still be thoroughly scrutinized using comprehensive resource accounting methods such as exergy-based approaches. In light of that, this study aims to conduct a detailed exergy analysis of whole-crop safflower biorefinery consisting of six units, i.e., straw handling, biomass pretreatment, bioethanol production, wastewater treatment, oil extraction, and biodiesel production. The analysis is carried out to find the major exergy sink in the developed biorefinery and discover the bottlenecks for further performance improvements. Overall, the wastewater treatment unit exhibits to be the major exergy sink, amounting to over 70% of the total thermodynamic irreversibility of the process. The biomass pretreatment and bioethanol production units account for 12.4 and 10.3% of the total thermodynamic inefficiencies of the process, respectively. The exergy rates associated with bioethanol, biodiesel, lignin, biogas, liquid digestate, seed cake, sodium sulfate, and glycerol are determined to be 5918.5, 16516.8, 10778.9, 1741.4, 6271.5, 15755.8, 3.4, and 823.5 kW, respectively. The overall exergetic efficiency of the system stands at 72.7%, demonstrating the adequacy of the developed biorefinery from the thermodynamic perspective. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to the increasing demand for monitoring diseases such as rising heart rate, diabetes, and ocular disorders wearable and implantable biomedical devices seems too essential for patients not only in the hospital but also at home or during working time. Researchers mostly try to offer valuable information on the conditions of patients as non-invasive, by using comfort biomedical device with a minimum side effect. So, small and self-powered with high sensitivity biomedical devices are recommended, among different power sources that introduced for devices, biofuel cells would be produced as power source for a range of medical devices because of its capability to generate sufficient power output compared to the primary power source. The nature of the electrode reaction and the nature of the biochemical reactions are some of the important parameters that are considered for the classification of fuel cells. Enzymatic biofuel cells due to high activity at mild conditions widely applied in pacemaker; glucometer; and smart contact lenses when compared to other kinds of biofuel cells. On the other hand, short lifespan is one of important limitations in this type of biofuel cells. So, the easiest way to overcome these challenges is to apply non-enzymatic ones. Recent studies have attempted to issue novel method for fabrication of non-enzymatic biofuel cell in order to produce a new generation which are inexpensive, disposable, selective, and sensitive in properties. However, consideration of researchers to the development of self-powered biomedical devices by using body fluids or providing electricity storage is rising. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) are considered as a promising technology to sustain the requirements of miniaturized portable energy sources. Electrode materials being one of the substantial aspects of EBFCs have stimulated immense interest in research. A new platform made of nanocomposite, involving magnetic particles of iron oxide (Fe3O4), carbon nanotubes (CNT), gold nanoparticles (Au) and a conducting polymer polypyrrole (PPy), was used as the electrode support for the immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOD) which improves the bioelectrocatalysis of the enzyme towards oxidation of glucose. The structural and electrochemical characterization of the modified bioanode GCE/PPy/Au/CNT@Fe3O4/FRT/GOD was performed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The performance of the bioanode was evaluated with promising results showing the maximum current density of 6.01 mA cm−2 (0.22 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in 40 mM of glucose concentration at 0.38 V open circuit potential (OCV). The results suggested that PPy/Au/CNT@Fe3O4 nanocomposite significantly improve the surface area of the electrode and served as a suitable environment for enzyme immobilization, and established good electrical communication by facilitating electron transfer between enzymes and electrode surface. The as-synthesized composite has been inferred as a promising platform for improved bioelectrocatalysis owing to the excellent combination of superparamagnetism of Fe3O4 with good electrocatalytic properties of CNT, PPy, and Au nanoparticles. Thus PPy/Au/CNT@Fe3O4 nanocomposite can be considered as a prospective electrode material for developing better electrochemical biosensors and biofuel cell anode. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Many investigations have introduced MgO as a favorable solid base catalyst. Although magnesium oxide catalyst does not have as strong of basic sites as calcium oxide catalyst, it is stable under ambient conditions. Furthermore, magnesium oxide catalyst activity is not sensitive to the water content of the reactants, which makes magnesium oxide catalyst possible for commercial purposes. In addition, the use of the non-magnetic catalyst could be facilely recovered by magnetic and reusable several times without a notable decrease in catalytic activity. In the present study, MgO /Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst was synthesized by precipitation method for biodiesel production. This nanocatalyst was characterized by different techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) to recognize functional groups, measurement magnetic characteristics by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), identification of the phase and crystalline structure of nanocatalysts using X-radiation (XRD) and a survey of morphology and surface properties by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then, the synthesized catalyst was utilized to synthesis biodiesel from the transesterification reaction of camelina seed oil with methyl alcohol. A high biodiesel efficiency (99 %) was obtained under optimized conditions using the central composite design (CCD) based on the response surface methodology (RSM). The optimization was carried out in two separate parts; the initial part focuses on the optimization of the variables affecting the catalytic performance and the second part includes optimizing the variables affecting the reaction conditions of biodiesel production. The biodiesel was examined by GC- Mass spectra and physicochemical characteristics such as viscosity and refractive index. The optimum performance was achieved over MgO /Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst at calcination time 2.29 h, calcination temperature 650 ͦ C, 55.25 % w/w MgO to Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst, methanol to oil molar ratio 12/1, the catalyst to oil weight ratio 4.9 % w/w, reaction temperature 70 ͦ C and reaction time 4.1 h. Moreover, MgO /Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst could be removed facilely from the reaction system by a magnet and catalytic performance maintained for the four reused cycles. Based on the results, camelina seed oil could be utilized as a promising alternative biofuel for impressive, renewable and green production of biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The remarkable enhancement of phenolic monomer generation and hydrogen was achieved through catalytic pyrolysis of Douglas fir over nanocellulose derived biochar catalyst for the first time. The main compositions of produced bio-oil were phenolic monomers, furans, and naphthalenes, etc., in which the phenolic monomers were dominant compositions. And at the temperature of 650 °C and 3 of biochar to biomass ratio, the quantification results showed that the concentration of phenol was increased to 53.77 mg/mL from 15.76 mg/mL of free of biochar catalyst. The concentration of cresols were facilitated to 44.51 mg/mL from 20.95 mg/mL, while the concentration of dimethylphenols reduced to 7.76 mg/mL from 9.11 mg/mL. Up to 85.32 vol% of hydrogen was observed, increasing from 45.53 vol% of the non-catalytic process. After 15 cycles of reuse, biochar catalysts still favored to produce a much higher concentration of phenolic monomers and hydrogen than that of absence of biochar catalysts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermally treated sewage sludge was pyrolyzed at temperatures of 300, 500, and 700 °C with antibiotic mycelial residue addition ratios of 0, 10, 25, and 50 wt%. The results showed that co-pyrolysis could obviously improve biochar properties. Specifically, adding antibiotic mycelial residue increased the aromaticity and raised the higher heating value of the biochar, which indicates its better potential as fuel. The enrichment in functional groups improved the surface properties of biochar, indicating its better applicability. Additionally, the heavy metal concentrations in biochar were diluted by adding antibiotic mycelial residue, which led to lower toxic inputs to the environment. Moreover, heavy metals were transformed to more stable fractions after co-pyrolysis. A higher pyrolysis temperature and greater antibiotic mycelial residue amounts led to better immobilization of heavy metals, thus preventing their leaching to the environment. This work proposes a promising technique for the synergetic treatment of sewage sludge and antibiotic mycelial residue for improved biochar formation. © 2020

AB  - Olive agro-industry is a chemical- and energy-intensive agricultural activity and given its large scale globally is faced with serious challenges from the sustainability perspective. On the other hand, different by-products and residues generated are not generally used and end up as wastes. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to design and implement innovative platforms based on circular bioeconomy and zero-discharge principles to enhance the sustainability features of the olive supply chain system. In light of that, the present study was aimed at designing and experimentally scrutinizing two olive agro-biorefinery scenarios against the conventional olive oil production system (i.e., olive/olive oil production, including olive cultivation and oil extraction). The first agro-biorefinery system included olive cultivation and oil extraction from fruit and pomace for edible use. Moreover, the remaining pomace post-oil extraction was used as an animal feed. The second agro-biorefinery system included olive cultivation, olive oil extraction, olive pomace oil extraction, and its conversion into biodiesel. In addition, crude biodiesel glycerol was also valorized into two different phosphate salts and an oxygenated fuel additive (namely triacetin), while olive oil leaves were converted into a natural antioxidant for biodiesel. The performance of the natural antioxidant against the most promising synthetic antioxidant used by the biodiesel industry (i.e., propyl gallate) was also investigated. The developed scenarios were environmentally compared using the IMPACT 2002+ method. Overall, both developed agro-biorefineries outperformed the conventional system in terms of all four endpoint damage categories. Compared to the conventional olive oil production system, the production of 1 ton of olive oil in the first and second agro-biorefinery systems was associated with 10.62% and 4.08% saving in climate change damage category, 6.73% and 11.21% saving in primary energy consumption, and 12.01% and 1.55% saving in damage to human health. In addition, the implementation of the circular bioeconomy approach in olive oil production led to 31.28% and 26.38% saving in ecosystem quality damage category for Sc-2 and Sc-3, respectively. Overall, the weighted endpoint damage categories of olive oil production could be saved by 12.27% and 4.49% if respectively, the first and second agro-biorefinery scenarios were used. These findings revealed that through the transition from linear economy-oriented olive agri-food system to a bioeconomy-oriented olive agro-biorefinery, not only a wide spectrum of value-added bioproducts could be achieved, but also the environmental impacts per each ton of olive oil produced could be mitigated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of alcohol fuels from bioderived feedstocks and the performance of next generation stratified low temperature combustion (LTC) modes for internal combustion engines are two research areas that have recently undergone rapid growth independently. Now, there is a need to bridge these two fields and identify the optimal combustion strategy for these biosynthesized alcohol fuels. This work addresses this need by using a metric called the normalized φ-sensitivity to analyze how the local ignition delays of regions in the combustion chamber respond to stratification induced by the compression stroke injection of fuel, thereby identifying the optimal next generation stratified LTC strategy for a number of biosynthesized alcohol fuels. The large set of next generation stratified LTC modes are generalized into two groups based on how the heat release process proceeds in the compositionally stratified combustion chamber: lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion, where the lean regions ignite first followed sequentially by progressively richer regions, or rich-to-lean burn stratified combustion, the inverse of lean-to-rich. The C1-C4 alcohols are prime candidates to enable lean-to-rich burn stratified combustion based on their high cooling potentials and lack of negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior. Specifically, methanol or water-alcohol blends were found to be the best candidates. The C5 + alcohols were found to be prime candidates to enable rich-to-lean burn combustion based on their emergent NTC-behavior and low cooling potentials that approach their alkane counterparts. Specifically, n-pentanol, n-hexanol, and hexanol isomers were found to be the best candidates based on balancing their normalized φ-sensitivity and their autoignition resistance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The pre-treatment and pelletisation of oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) can potentially improve its biofuel properties for efficient thermal energy recovery. Therefore, this paper examines the physicochemical, thermal, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties of OPEFB pellets as a potential feedstock for pyrolysis. Physicochemical analysis revealed high proportions of carbon, volatiles, and fixed carbon compared to nitrogen and sulphur. Morphological analysis showed that the pellet microstructure is comprised of a dense network of polymeric fibres, whereas its ash has consistently shaped agglomerated particles with fine-textured surfaces. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed the OPEFB pellets experienced significant mass loss (ML = 72.8–80.4%) and residual mass (RM = 19.6–27.2%) during thermal decomposition from 30 to 800 °C. The DTG plots revealed thermal decomposition occurred in three stages: I (30–150 °C), II (150–600 °C), and III (600–800 °C) due to drying, devolatilization, and char degradation, respectively. Kinetic analysis showed the activation energy, Ea, ranged from 76.87 to 195.78 kJ/mol, while frequency factor, A, was from 4.77 × 1001 to 1.22 × 1018 min−1 for the Flynn-Wall Ozawa and Kissinger-Akahira Sunose models. The highest kinetic parameters were observed at α = 0.40, indicating the rate-determining step for OPEFB pellets decomposition under pyrolysis condition occurs at 40% conversion. Thermodynamic analysis showed that thermal decomposition of OPEFB pellets was characterised by the formation of an activated complex, high reactive multiphase first-order reactions, and short reaction times. In conclusion, the results indicate that OPEFB pellets is a potentially suitable feedstock for pyrolysis owing to its excellent fuel properties and environmentally friendly nature. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The synergistic photoelectrochemical (PEC) technology is a robust process for the conversion of CO2 into fuels. However, designing a highly efficient UV–visible driven photoelectrocatalyst is still challenging. Herein, a plasmonic Ag NPs modified TiO2/RGO photoelectrocatalyst (Ag–TiO2/RGO) has been designed for the PEC CO2 reduction into selective production of CH3OH. HR-TEM analysis revealed that Ag and TiO2 NPs with average sizes of 4 and 7 nm, respectively, were densely grown on the few-micron-sized 2D RGO nanosheets. The physicochemical analysis was used to determine the optical and textural properties of the Ag–TiO2/RGO nanohybrids. Under VU-Vis light illumination, Ag–TiO2/RGO photocathode possessed a current density of 23.5 mA cm−2 and a lower electrode resistance value of 125 Ω in CO2-saturated 1.0 M KOH-aqueous electrolyte solution. Catalytic studies showed that the Ag–TiO2/RGO photocathode possessed a remarkable PEC CO2 reduction activity and selective production of CH3OH with a yield of 85 μmol L−1 cm−2, the quantum efficiency of 20% and Faradic efficiency of 60.5% at onset potential of −0.7 V. A plausible PEC CO2 reduction mechanism over Ag–TiO2/RGO photocathode is schematically demonstrated. The present work gives a new avenue to develop high-performance and stable photoelectrocatalyst for PEC CO2 reduction towards sustainable liquid fuels production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Carbon capture and sequestration technologies are used to reduce carbon emissions. Membranes, solvents, and adsorbents are the three major methods of CO2 capture. One of the promising methods is the use of algae to absorb CO2 from flue gases and convert it into biomass. Algae have great potential as renewable fuel sources and CO2 capture using photosynthesis for carbon fixation has also attracted much attention. This paper presents an extensive and in-depth report on the utilization of algae for carbon capture and accumulation. This is done in conjunction with cultivating the algae for the production of biomass for biodiesel production. Different systems are investigated for algae cultivation as well as carbon capture to effectively mitigate carbon emissions. The performance and productivity of these biosystems depend on various conditions including algae type, light sources, nutrients, pH, temperature, and mass transfer. Macroalgae and microalgae species were explored to determine their suitability for carbon capture and sequestration, along with the production of biodiesel. The steps for producing biodiesel were comprehensively reviewed, which are harvesting, dehydrating, oil extraction, oil refining, and transesterification. This technology combines active carbon capture with the potential of biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diminishing oil reserve, escalating energy dependence, and the environmental impact of fossil fuel utilization has led to research on renewable energy resources with a cleaner carbon footprint. Biofuel, especially biodiesel, has become a feasible substitute for petroleum diesel as it can be directly used in existing transport infrastructure without significant alteration. This paper starts by discussing some critical physicochemical properties and their effect on engine performance and emission. The research then proposes a ranking scheme to select the most suitable biodiesel based on six vital physicochemical properties: density, viscosity, heating value, flash point, cetane number and oxidation stability. The solution developed is independent of supervision, contrary to popular learning algorithms and can operate on the only intelligence whether an attribute is favourable by its higher/lower values. The novelty of the work consists in ensuring that the rarer properties pick up the greater weights and in establishing a simple ranker based on descriptive statistics. This scheme first generates transactions against each biodiesel which helps in association rule mining, which is later used to score/rank the biodiesels. The three phases and their subordinate sub-steps have been carried out using the platforms: Python, R and Tableau, respectively. The study endorses Brassica juncea, Cardoon (Cynara cardunculu), and poppyseed oil as the most desirable biodiesel feedstocks. On the other hand, cedar, castor and hiptage were ranked as least desirable in the list of 71 feedstocks based on the proposed ranking scheme. The proposed ranking scheme will help decision-makers such to analyze and obtain tailored biodiesel feedstock for their purposes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is an effective method for the conversion of biomass into biofuel involving moderate temperature and high pressure. However, the yield and quality of bio-oil are not sufficient for commercialization under normal HTL conditions. In this regard, the review emphasizes the need to select the appropriate catalyst for achieving high bio-oil yields with improved quality. Besides, the factors influencing the catalytic HTL, including the types of catalyst used in HTL, the mechanism of catalytic-HTL reaction, the effect of the catalyst on other HTL products including biochar, aqueous phase extracts, and gas, are discussed in detail. This review also summarizes by mentioning the barriers to be overcome in catalytic HTL by focusing on promising approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This review aims to encourage the technical development of microbial biodiesel production from industrial-organic-wastes-derived volatile fatty acids (VFAs). To this end, this article summarizes the current status of several key technical steps during microbial biodiesel production, including (1) acidogenic fermentation of bio-wastes for VFA collection, (2) lipid accumulation in oleaginous microorganisms, (3) microbial lipid extraction, (4) transesterification of microbial lipids into crude biodiesel, and (5) crude biodiesel purification. The emerging membrane-based bioprocesses such as electrodialysis, forward osmosis and membrane distillation, are promising approaches as they could help tackle technical challenges related to the separation and recovery of VFAs from the fermentation broth. The genetic engineering and metabolic engineering approaches could be applied to design microbial species with higher lipid productivity and rapid growth rate for enhanced fatty acids synthesis. The enhanced in situ transesterification technologies aided by microwave, ultrasound and supercritical solvents are also recommended for future research. Technical limitations and cost-effectiveness of microbial biodiesel production from bio-wastes are also discussed, in regard to its potential industrial development. Based on the overview on microbial biodiesel technologies, an integrated biodiesel production line incorporating all the critical technical steps is proposed for unified management and continuous optimization for highly efficient biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dependence on fossil fuels for meeting the growing energy demand is damaging the world’s environment. There is a dire need to look for alternative fuels that are less potent to greenhouse gas emissions. Biofuels offer several advantages with less harmful effects on the environment. Biodiesel is synthesized from the organic wastes produced extensively like edible, non-edible, microbial, and waste oils. This study reviews the feasibility of the state-of-the-art feedstocks for sustainable biodiesel synthesis such as availability, and capacity to cover a significant proportion of fossil fuels. Biodiesel synthesized from oil crops, vegetable oils, and animal fats are the potential renewable carbon-neutral substitute to petroleum fuels. This study concludes that waste oils with higher oil content including waste cooking oil, waste palm oil, and algal oil are the most favorable feedstocks. The comparison of biodiesel production and parametric analysis is done critically, which is necessary to come up with the most appropriate feedstock for biodiesel synthesis. Since the critical comparison of feedstocks along with oil extraction and biodiesel production technologies has never been done before, this will help to direct future researchers to use more sustainable feedstocks for biodiesel synthesis. This study concluded that the use of third-generation feedstocks (wastes) is the most appropriate way for sustainable biodiesel production. The use of innovative costless oil extraction technologies including supercritical and microwave-assisted transesterification method is recommended for oil extraction. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In the present work, zinc doped calcium oxide was used as a nanocatalyst for biodiesel production from castor oil. The optimal conditions of biodiesel conversion and green chemistry balance were obtained with response surface methodology. Five green chemistry parameters like carbon efficiency, atom economy, reaction mass efficiency, stoichiometric factor and environmental factor were optimized. The sustainable biodiesel yield 84.9% and green chemistry balance 0.902 was achieved at methanol to oil molar ratio 10.5:1, temperature 57 °C, time 70 min, and catalyst concentration 2.15%. The synthesized biodiesel was characterized by GCMS and FTIR, and physic-chemical properties were determined. Based on experimental study annually 20.3 million kg capacity plant was simulated using SuperPro designer. The sensitivity analysis of oil purchase cost and biodiesel selling price on ROI, payback period, IRR and NPV were investigated. The optimization and technoeconomic analysis provided a sustainable platform for commercial based biodiesel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to inspect the influence of the addition of n-heptanol with methyl oleate biodiesel fuel at various blending ratio on the combustion and emission parameters of a common rail diesel engine to attain their optimum ratio. The n-heptanol is added at 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%, which are denoted as H10B, H20B, H30B, and H40B respectively. Studying these mixtures stability, all blends were kept under observation for more than one month, and they were stable at ambient conditions. The measured physicochemical properties of n-heptanol-methyl oleate blends show that there is a reduction in their kinematic viscosity and cetane number. The results for methyl oleate illustrate that the peak pressure is slightly decreased by about 4%, while the soot and NOx emissions are diminished by about 2% and 6% respectively compared to pure diesel fuel. The soot and NOx emission are reduced by up to 90% and 15% respectively when adding n-heptanol. The bsfc is enlarged by around 5% methyl oleate while it is enlarged by 15% for n-heptanol- methyl oleate mixtures. It can be summarized from the combustion and emission results that the proposed mixing ratio of n-heptanol and methyl oleate fuel is H20B. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, wood bark of neem tree (Azadirachta indica) is transformed into liquid (bio-oil), solid (char) and gaseous products via pyrolysis method. The main aim of this study is to analyze the effect of process parameters on pyrolysis yield, physical and chemical characterization of bio-oil, char, and gaseous products to find its feasibility as a commercial fuel as well as chemical feedstocks. The flash pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor at a temperature ranging from 350 to 550°C, different particle sizes from 0.71 to 1.25 mm with a sweep gas flow rate of 1.25 to 2.25 m3/hr. The highest liquid product yield was obtained as 49.5 wt% at the pyrolysis temperature of 450°C, 1.0 mm particle size and at the sweep gas flow rate 2.0 m3/hr. The obtained bio-oil, char, and gaseous products were examined with FT-IR, GC-MS and Elemental analysis methods. Based on the elemental analysis of the bio-oil, the calorific value was found as 22.7 MJ/kg. GC-MS analysis of the bio-oil indicates that it mostly consists of phenolic and oxygenated compounds with alkanes, alkenes, ketones, and carboxylic acids. The pyrolysis gas fraction contains hydrogen, methane, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. The obtained bio-oil and gas can be used as a bio-fuel and bio-oil can be used as a valuable chemical feedstock. The char obtained are carbon-rich and are nearly equal to the standard fuel properties. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Cyclopentanol is a promising alternative biofuel for automobiles. In this study, an optical engine was employed to investigate the effects of cyclopentanol blending ratios on combustion characteristics. Cyclopentanol was blended with diesel by 10% and 20% volume, denoted as CP10 and CP20, respectively. Comparison tests between blends and diesel (denoted as D100) were performed under three injection pressures (100, 120, and 140 MPa) and four injection timings (−6°, −9°, −12° and −15° crank angle after top dead center (°CA ATDC)). The experimental results indicated that the addition of cyclopentanol prolongs the ignition delay, shortens the combustion duration and improves the indicated thermal efficiency. As the injection pressure increases or the injection timing advances, the peak combustion pressures (PCPs) and peak heat release rates (PHRRs) increase. Compared to D100, the PCPs and PHRRs of cyclopentanol/diesel fuel blends are lower and decrease with the increase of cyclopentanol ratio. Blending cyclopentanol in diesel is effective in reducing soot emission, and the reduction effect weakens as the injection pressure increases or the injection timing advances. CP10 is superior to CP20 according to the comprehensive evaluation of combustion and emission, especially at the injection timing of −12°CA ATDC under the injection pressure of 140 MPa. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel cells (BFCs)-based self-powered biosensors suffer from the limited stability of bioenzymes. Meanwhile, the poor performance of self-powered biosensors affects the sensitivity of biosensing, thus, it is significant and challenging to improve their stability and sensitivity. In our work, a BFC-based self-powered biosensor, with simultaneously enhanced stability and sensitivity, was constructed utilizing dual metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as the carriers of the bioenzyme and the electroactive probe, respectively. Anodic enzyme, glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), was encapsulated in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) to form GDH@ZIF-8 composites, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of GDH. Meanwhile, another zirconium metal-organic frameworks (UiO-66-NH2) loaded with electroactive molecules (K3[Fe(CN)6]) served as nano-enrichment carriers and improved the capability of the cathode to accept electrons from the anode, further improving the sensitivity of the as-proposed biosensor. Herein, the “signal-on” BFC-based self-powered biosensing of exosomes, the model analyte, with excellent stability and outstanding sensitivity was realized with the assistance of dual MOFs, and the detection limit was down to 300 particles mL−1 (based on 3s/k), which was superior to those previously reported in literatures. Furthermore, the developed protocol was capable of detecting exosomes derived from cancer cells in complex biological samples. Overall, in this work the enhancement of both stability and sensitivity has been achieved by utilizing two types of MOFs, which laid the foundation for expanding the applications of BFC-based self-powered biosensors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The human population blast has brought several problems related with the overconsumption of a wide range of feedstocks and natural resources conducting to their risk of depletion. The consumption of fossil fuels is an example, with increasing levels of exploitation and negative impacts caused by their use. Anthropogenic activities have triggered the over accumulation of many hazardous substances and wastes which are regarded to be detrimental to life in the Earth and to the various planet ecosystems. There is an urgent need to restore natural resources and unwanted residues and wastes to levels prior the demographic explosion. Microalgal biotechnology appears to be pivotal to achieve this goal in a near future to come. This review presents the current resource problems affecting the Earth and how microalgae are expected to be an important part of the solution, discussing how the production of renewable energy from microalgae can help in an integrated way to mitigate different environmental problems. Microalgae are able to convert wastewaters, CO2 and organic residues in marketable biomass for different uses, including biofuels, converting waste in value. An inventory of current microalgal-based biorefineries in operation as well as a directory of companies, products and applications are also presented. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal processing is an interesting biorefinery technology for converting lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels and biocompounds. This process is based on the selective solubilization and depolymerization of hemicellulose fraction (xylan) and may be considered beneficial, due to the possibility of obtaining xylooligosaccharides (XOS) with a degree of polymerization (DP) suitable for prebiotic applications. This study evaluated the effect of pressure (2.5 and 10 MPa) in a kinetic study (30 min) of hydrothermal treatment (180 °C) to optimize the extraction of XOS from mango seed shell. Total reducing sugars (TRS) values were close to the maximum in 15 min showing a slower rate for both pressures after this time, but at 10 MPa the value was 20 % lower than at 2.5 MPa. Based on these results, a new extraction was performed at 2.5 MPa and 15 min, and the extracted XOS were quantified, yielding 393.44 mg XOS/g xylan. XOS with a degree of polymerization between X2-X6 corresponded to 82.24 mg/g and XOS with X > 6 (or soluble xylan) corresponded to 311.20 mg/g. A low amount of xylose (8.81 mg/g xylan) was released, resulting in a hemicellulose conversion of 40.2 %. In general, approximately 8.1 kg of total XOS was produced from 100 kg of dried mango seed shell (X2-X6−1.7 kg and X > 6–6.4 kg). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Paper and pulp mills generate substantial quantities of cellulose-rich sludge materials that are disposed in landfills at a large scale. For sustainability purposes, sludge materials can be bioprocessed to produce renewable fuels and useful chemicals. The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose is the process bottleneck that affects the conversion economics directly by using zero-cost raw materials. In order to study and optimize the process, the characteristics of the sludge raw materials should be first evaluated. In this work, sludge samples were obtained from paper mills located at different locations in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Part of the sludge samples was washed (de-ashed) with hydrochloric acid while the other part remained unwashed. The samples were subjected to multiple spectroscopic analyses techniques to evaluate the morphological properties of cellulose fibers and to estimate the total structural carbohydrate content. The results showed that the de-ashing process changed some fiber characteristics and cellulose crystallinity structure in all sludge samples. Sludge sample A (obtained from Kraft pulp and recycled paper mill region) showed a high percentage of fiber, with crystalline cellulose, compared to the other two sludge samples suggesting that sludge A is a valuable source to make value-added products. Aspen Plus mass and energy calculations performed in view of the ‘zero’ cost and the reliable supply of sludge raw materials producing 2 mol H2/mol glucose. Moreover, the results showed that extracting crystalline cellulose from these sludge samples is more profitable than crystalline cellulose made from the other lignocellulosic feedstocks. The results reported here showed that the utilization of these sludge materials would be an economically attractive and promising alternative for the production of hydrogen. © 2020

AB  - Biodiesel is a fuel that has numerous benefits over traditional petrodiesel. The transesterification process is the most popular method for biodiesel production from various sources, categorized as first, second and third generation biodiesel depending on the source. The transesterification process is subject to a variety of factors that can be taken into account to improve biodiesel yield. One of the factors is catalyst type and concentration, which plays a significant role in the transesterification of biodiesel sources. At present, chemical and biological catalysts are being investigated and each catalyst has its advantages and disadvantages. Recently, nanocatalysts have drawn researchers’ attention to the efficient production of biodiesel. This article discusses recent work on the role of several nanocatalysts in the transesterification reaction of various sources in the development of biodiesel. A large number of literature from highly rated journals in scientific indexes is reviewed, including the most recent publications. Most of the authors reported that nanocatalysts show an important influence regarding activity and selectivity. This study highlights that in contrast to conventional catalysts, the highly variable surface area of nanostructure materials favours interaction between catalysts and substrates that efficiently boost the performance of products. Finally, this analysis provides useful information to researchers in developing and processing cost-effective biodiesel. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work establishes a simple, customized, and economical laser-induced graphene (LIG) material produced using a CO2 laser. The one-step LIG bioelectrodes have been further validated for Enzymatic Biofuel Cell (EBFC) application by integrating them into a microfluidic device, fabricated by the conventional soft-lithography on Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). This electrode and device manufacturing technology delivers a simple and quick fabrication method, which eliminates the necessity of any further amendment and post-processing. LIG electrodes were created at optimized CO2 laser (5.1 W power and 0.625 cm s−1 speed) irradiation which has been further modified by Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT), called C-LIG electrodes, which offers improved performance and enzyme stability. In this novel study, CNT functionalized LIG electrodes have been incorporated into a microfluidic device for biofuel cell applications. LIG and C-LIG bioelectrodes have been integrated into a microfluidic device under the laminar fluid flow regime and the electrochemical and polarization study of the platform have been carried out. This C-LIG bioelectrodes integrated microfluidic device, without any metal catalyst, generated 2.2 μW/cm2 power density with an optimized 200 μl/min flow rate which is 1.37 times higher than the LIG bioelectrodes. Such novel and simple EBFC platform is amenable to further improvement for generating even more power output by optimizing the LIG formation, alternate nano-functionalisation and mediator based electrochemical analysis. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - In this work, the conversion of Enteromorpha clathrata into bio-oil through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) was investigated under different preparation conditions. A two-step reaction method was compared with single-step reaction. At a high temperature, bio-oil produced through the two-step hydrothermal reaction displayed slight changes in yield, but solid residue rate was low. The liquid-to-material ratio of the optimal preparation condition was 40/4 (mL/g). Bio-oil produced in each experiment at this ratio was further analyzed using GC/MS. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) quantitative calculation was used in analyzing and proving the possible reaction path of the conversion of furan compounds to aromatic compounds during a direct high-temperature liquefaction process. Results revealed that the two-step method can ensure a high bio-oil yield, while preventing the occurrence of side reactions caused by long-term high-temperature reactions, and improve the bio-oil quality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Steam gasification enables the thermochemical conversion of solid fuels into a medium calorific gas that can be utilized for the synthesis of advanced biofuels, chemicals or for heat and power production. Dual fluidized bed (DFB) gasification is at present the technology applied to realize gasification of biomass in steam environment at large scale. Few large-scale DFB gasifiers exist, and this work presents a compilation and analysis of the data and operational strategies from the six DFB gasifiers in Europe. It is shown that the technology is robust, as similar gas quality can be achieved despite the differences in reactor design and operation strategies. Reference concentrations of both gas components and tar components are provided, and correlations in the data are investigated. In all plants, adjusting the availability and accessibility to the active ash components (K and Ca) was the key to control the gas quality. The gas quality, and in particular the tar content of the gas, can conveniently be assessed by monitored the concentration of CH4 in the produced gas. The data and experience acquired from these plants provide important knowledge for the future development of the steam gasification of biomass. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - In this paper, cloisite 30B (CL) was converted to tosylated cloisite (TCL) as new heterofunctional support. Lipase from Candida rugosa was covalently immobilized on the TCL (TCLL) and used to produce biodiesel from waste frying oil (WFO). The effects of reaction time and temperature, the molar ratio of methanol/oil, and the water content on the biodiesel yield were also explored. The hydrolytic activity of TCLL was 1.96 ± 0.04 U mg−1, with the immobilization yield of 93.6% and expressed activity of 90.2%. The maximum yield of biodiesel (97.1 ± 1.1%) was obtained at 50 °C for 8 h with a 15:1 M ratio of methanol to WFO and water content 10 wt%. The features of produced biodiesel, such as acid value, iodine value, density, and viscosity, met the specifications in the reported standard test methods. After 24 h incubation at 80 °C, the relative yield of biodiesel for TCLL was 20.3%, while the relative yield for the free enzyme was almost zero. The relative yield of biodiesel for TCLL and free lipase was 70.6% and 33.4%, respectively, after 30 days of storage. Also, TCLL showed a relative yield of 61.3% in the biodiesel production after being used for 10 cycles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sustainable development is the common goal of the current concepts of bioeconomy and circular economy. In this sense, the biorefineries platforms are a strategic factor to increase the bioeconomy in the economic balance. The incorporation of renewable sources to produce fuels, chemicals, and energy, includes sustainability, reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG), and creating more manufacturing jobs fostering the advancement of regional and social systems by implementing the comprehensive use of available biomass, due to its low costs and high availability. This paper describes the emerging biorefinery strategies to produce fuels (bio-ethanol and γ-valerolactone) and energy (pellets and steam), compared with the currently established biorefineries designed for fuels, pellets, and steam. The focus is on the state of the art of biofuels and energy production and environmental factors, as well as a discussion about the main conversion technologies, production strategies, and barriers. Through the implementation of biorefineries platforms and the evaluation of low environmental impact technologies and processes, new sustainable production strategies for biofuels and energy can be established, making these biobased industries into more competitive alternatives, and improving the economy of the current value chains. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Development of reliable Enzymatic Biofuel Cells (EBFC)-based self-powered glucose biosensor for continuous, noninvasive monitoring without restriction on patient's movement is highly recommendable. However, its application to a large extent is limited by the relatively poor stability. Herein, we synthesized a highly flexible electrode for effective enzyme immobilization by encapsulating enzyme into the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and robustly anchored to the cellulose acetate (CA) nanofiber membrane. As is well-known, such nanostructured fiber materials are the first time to be synthesized for glucose biosensor, which encapsulated biomolecules in MOFs platform during the MOFs in-situ growth on the nanofiber membranes. The as-proposed biosensor demonstrated excellent stability over 15 h of continuous long-term monitoring. The remarkable stability of assembled self-powered glucose biosensor in this work could inspire the application of enzymatic biosensors in biometrics, chronic disease management and clinical diagnosis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently, the supply of diminishing fossil fuel reserves, and the rise in challenges in environmental, political and economic consequences have caused the great concerns in the development of modern society; these have forced the policy-makers and researchers to look for the renewable and green energy sources. Deemed as a promising renewable alternative to traditional fossil fuels, 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF, chemical formula C6H8O)-a derivative of furan-has the potential to relieve the growing shortage of fossil fuels while satisfying the increase in global energy demand and minimizing the adverse effects of climate change. DMF can be used as a clean source of liquid transportation biofuel given the fact that it is directly obtained from biomass-derived carbohydrates. In reviewing current DMF production methods, this review paper analyzes and presents the comparison of catalytic performance in the conversion of biomass into DMF. In addition, the applicability of DMF in spark-ignition (SI) engines is thoroughly analyzed based on the spray and flame, combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of SI engines running on DMF compared with ethanol and gasoline. More interestingly, the knocking, lubrication, and wear characteristics in SI engines fueled with DMF are also evaluated and discussed. Nonetheless, further investigation on optimization strategies on DMF production process should be conducted prior to the initiation of large-scale commercialization as well as the application of DMF to real-world SI engines.

AB  - Over the years, there has been a substantial increase in the demands of a portable, green source of energy for powering microelectronics to be used as sensors, medical implants and other lab-on-chip devices. Microfluidic microbial fuel cells have been identified as a genuine option to address these requirements. These cells operating at microscale level are characterised by laminar flow of fuel and oxidant which eradicates the requirement of a membrane ensuring higher performance and improved reaction rates than conventional fuel cells. Owing to these advantages, microsized microbial fuel cells have been extensively used to design micro power sources for environmental biosensors, point-of-care diagnostics, medical implants. However, the microfluidic microbial fuel cell technology suffers from some noteworthy disadvantages which need to be addressed before the commercialization of technology. The review comprehensively discusses the development, and advancements in microfluidic microbial fuel cell technology followed by their current applications, challenges, the possible solutions and future prospects. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Production of low carbon biofuels and biochemicals from renewable feedstocks using a biological process is considered a sustainable alternative to the fossil-fuel-based linear economy. This study demonstrated the pilot-scale (10 m3) production of biohydrogen (bio-H2) and volatile fatty acids/carboxylic acids (VFA) through acidogenic fermentation (AF) using food waste (FW) as renewable feedstock. Bio-H2 production of 54 288 L (155.10 LH2 per kg COD) along with 25.77 g L-1 of VFA composed of acetic (HAc: 15.2 ± 1.98 g L-1), propionic (HPr: 4.89 ± 1.26 g L-1) and butyric (HBu 5.67 ± 0.96 g L-1) acids was achieved within 48 h of the fermentation period. The further acidogenic process was integrated with a biorefinery platform (methanogenesis + photosynthesis) in a circular loop strategy which helped derive multiple biobased products (CH4, algal biomass, O2 and treated water for reuse) from fatty acid-rich acidogenic effluent and untreated COD of AF. The whole bio-manufacturing unit (acidogenesis + methanogenesis + photosynthesis) converted the renewable feedstock (waste/wastewater) into fuels and platform chemicals, in analogy to a conventional oil refinery with a maximized resource recovery. The life cycle assessment (LCA) tool was employed to study the environmental impact of both the bio-H2 (standalone, ST) and waste biorefinery (WB) processes, and the results depicted that the WB approach offered a relatively low impact (approx. 3.5 fold less than ST). The approach helped determine the flow of carbon and its conversion to products; this aided the reduction of carbon emissions as well as minimized the burden on natural resources with the biosynthesis of green H2 and other value-added products, addressing carbon neutrality with bioeconomy. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Transition metal compounds have been widely used to enhance the anaerobic digestion (AD) performance, while the role of transition metal compounds in enhancing AD performance remains unclarified. In this work, the function of transition metal oxide accelerants (tantalum oxide, niobium oxide, hafnium oxide, and tungsten oxide) in enhanced AD systems was investigated from experimental and theoretical standpoints. Higher biogas production (565.01–617.85 mL/g VS), chemical oxygen demand degradation rate (67.17%-70.45%), total solids and volatile solids reduction rates (29.76%-34.71%, 51.83%-60.88%) were achieved in AD systems with transition metal oxide accelerants than the control (327.08 mL/g VS, 56.65%, 22.65%, and 41.18%). The first-principle density functional theory calculations, electron exchange capacity analysis, and the 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing demonstrated superior electron transfer and exchange capacities as well as microbial consortia development in transition metal oxides-induced DIET mechanism. This work provides a promising strategy for understanding the function of high-performance accelerants in AD systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Usage of traditional biomass raises serious concerns regarding its sustainability due to the inefficient combustion in household stoves and potential over-usage if the intention is to replace fossil fuels in power plants. Co-pyrolysis of biomass feedstock with different waste materials, especially plastics, might be a promising alternative for sustainable usage of enhanced biofuels. Even more, co-pyrolysis can help to integrate waste management schemes into the power production sector. Plastics materials have properties similar to those of fossil fuels in terms of heating value and the absence of oxygenated compounds; therefore, they could significantly improve the properties of biomass products, especially bio-oils. Especially interesting for this method is polystyrene (PS) since it yields a high share of liquid fraction, which is the most valuable pyrolytic product. In this work, co-pyrolysis was performed for a mixture of waste biomass sawdust (oak, poplar and fir wood) and waste polystyrene from dairy product packaging. Pyrolysis was carried out for sawdust and polystyrene alone, and their respective fuel blends (PS/SD 25−75%, PS/SD 50−50%, PS/SD 75−25%) from room temperature to 600 °C with a retention time of half an hour. The highest yield of liquid fraction was noticed for mixtures with 75 % of PS, while the lowest one was for blends with 25 % of PS, with a yield of 83.86 % and 62.33 %, respectively. Additionally, the mass spectrometric analysis was carried out to determine the chemical composition of the obtained oil. © 2020

AB  - This study investigated the engine performance and emission characteristics of biodiesel blends with combined Graphene oxide nanoplatelets (GNPs) and 10% v/v dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as fuel additives as well as analysed the tribological characteristics of those blends. 10% by volume DMC was mixed with 30% palm oil biodiesel blends with diesel. Three different concentrations (40, 80 and 120 ppm) of GNPs were added to these blends via the ultrasonication process to prepare the nanofuels. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) surfactant was added to improve the stability of these blends. GNPs were characterised using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), while the viscosity of nanofuels was investigated by rheometer. UV-spectrometry was used to determine the stability of these nanoplatelets. A ratio of 1:4 GNP: SDS was found to produce maximum stability in biodiesel. Performance and emissions characteristics of these nanofuels have been investigated in a four-stroke compression ignition engine. The maximum reduction in BSFC of 5.05% and the maximum BTE of 22.80% was for B30GNP40DMC10 compared to all other tested blends. A reduction in HC (25%) and CO (4.41%) were observed for B30DMC10, while a reduction in NOx of 3.65% was observed for B30GNP40DMC10. The diesel-biodiesel fuel blends with the addition of GNP exhibited a promising reduction in the average coefficient of friction 15.05%, 8.68% and 3.61% for 120, 80 and 40 ppm concentrations compared to B30. Thus, combined GNP and DMC showed excellent potential for utilisation in diesel engine operation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increased population and industrialization generate a large number of organic pollutants that create problems on the planet earth. The level of freshwater is reducing which has pushed the society to reuse/recycle wastewater. Eco-friendly and economically sound treatment of industrial wastewater has attracted global attention and hence is a thrust area of research. Organic compounds rich wastewater can be used to generate bioenergy and value-added products from the resource recovery point of view. Wastewater treatment(s) can be used to trap energy from industrial effluents in form of biofuel, bioenergy and biogas. Recovered products can be used in various ways such as recovered nutrients for (bio)fertilizer production and algal biomass for bioplastic production. Microbial electrochemical technology is a promising approach for resource recovery. This review article aims to present and discuss trends and scientific developments about recovery of value-added products from dye industry effluent. It also provides state-of-art technical information about technologies for remediation of pollutants from dye industry effluent with emphasis on nanotechnological approaches and microbial electrochemical technologies (METs). It narrates literature on classification and properties of dyes, effects of dye pollutants on environment and human health and factors affecting degradation of dyes. Generation of bioenergy and recovery of valuables from dye industrial wastewater along with challenges and perspectives of this research area have been covered. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study evaluated in-situ co-transesterification of wet spent coffee ground (SCG)/microalgae mixture for enhanced biodiesel production. SCG and microalgae showed lipid contents of 16.0 and 23.6 wt%, respectively. A total of 27 transesterification runs were performed using wet SCG:algae (1:1, w/w) at different temperatures, times, and solvent ratios. Box-Behnken quadratic model suggested 198 °C, 6 mL solvent g−1 biomass, and reaction time of 132 min as the optimum conditions for maximum biodiesel yield. At different SCG/microalgae blend ratios, pure microalgae showed the highest biodiesel yield of 20.15 wt%. Increase of SCG ratio resulted in significant reduction in the biodiesel yield, reaching the lowest value of 11.2 wt% using pure SCG. On the other hand, SCG showed better biodiesel characteristics than microalgae regarding iodine value, cetane number, and oxidation stability. The present results confirmed that SCG-algae blend results in dual effect of enhancing biodiesel yield and quality, comparing to the individual transesterification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work analyses the performance and emission characteristics of biofuelled compression ignition (C.I) engine with the implementation of an antioxidant. Using the transesterification process with sodium hydroxide as a catalyst, the beef tallow methyl ester (BTME) was obtained from the beef tallow oil. Poor physical properties of biodiesel (beef tallow oil (BTO)) namely high viscosity and density cause atomization problems leading to higher smoke, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. The purpose of this work is to enhance the performance aspects, to limit smoke emissions from BTO operation and to examine the possibility of direct use of neat BTO in CI engine. This research paves a way of investing the impact of binary blends of BHA and BTO on the research engine. The experiments were conducted on a single-cylinder four-stroke C.I engine using the following fuel compositions: 20% of BTME mixed with 80% diesel (B20), 1000 ppm mono-phenolic antioxidant (butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)) mixed with the blends of B20 (B20 + BHA), and 100% diesel. Based on the experimental results, it was found that the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) increases by 1.8% and the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreases by 2.5% for the fuel blend B20 + BHA when compared with that for B20 fuel blend. Compared with the B20 blend, the blend B20 + BHA emits 12.2% lesser nitrogen oxide due to breaking chain reactions, scavenging the initiating radicals and reducing the concentration of reactive radicals. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Thermochemical methods namely pyrolysis, gasification/hydrothermal gasification, combustion, hydrothermal liquefaction and hydrothermal carbonization are widely practiced to convert algal biomass into fuels. Among the methods, pyrolysis, and hydrothermal liquefaction are most commonly practised to convert numerous algal biomasses into bio-oil and/or biochar to substitute crude oil in petroleum refinery. In this regard, this review is focused on the conversion of various microalgal; and cyanobacterial biomasses into bio-oil, and solid char products through pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction. Initially, pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction of algal biomass on bio-oil and biochar yield have been reviewed. As the composition and yield of bio-oil from algae depends on the reaction temperature, detailed account of the impact of temperature on the quantity and quality of bio-oil and solid char obtained from pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction were comprehensively presented in the review. Eventually, this article provides opportunities and scope in the pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction of algae for further research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae and macroalgae are known for their use in food and fuel applications. Recently, tremendous interest on algal biomass for biochar production has been increased. Biochar are well known for its catalytic activity to produce many finished products such as alternative fuels, treat environmental waste water and act as an input for agricultural applications. Three routes are commonly adopted for alternative fuel production from algal biomass namely, biochemical, chemical, and thermochemical techniques. Recently, thermochemical methods for the conversion of algal biomass to biochar are employed to use biochar based catalyst. Biochar must be activated before used as a potential catalyst. Therefore, this review has given broad information of various activation strategies for biochar modification. Different activation methods such as physical and chemical modes are being practiced to modify the biochar for efficient catalyst in alternative fuel production. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Power generation from the renewable biomass sources using microbial fuel cell (MFC) has attracted significant attention in recent years, while chemical energy stored in microalgae biomass has efficiently been used for the sustainable production of biofuels and other valuable bioproducts since the decades. The usage of these photosynthetic organisms in MFC can enhance the efficiency of MFC and provide a cost-effective and renewable approach for the bio-generation of electricity. Microalgae are commonly incorporated either with anode or cathode compartment of MFC to generate electron or oxygen, respectively. Despite microalgae-assisted MFC (MA-MFC) would be more sustainable than using MFC alone, further developments in such systems are still required for improving its efficiency and achieving a real-world application on a large scale. In this context, understanding in bio-electrochemical mechanism of MA-MFC, including electrons shuttle and oxygen generation, is very important. Moreover, many factors can limit the efficiency and performances of MA-MFCs that are needed to optimize in further research efforts. This review presents a comprehensive insight into MA-MFC, including the recent developments and potential challenges in this promising bio-electricity generating system. Specifically, it focuses a critical discussion on the configurations of MA-MFC, key operating parameters affecting performances of MA-MFC, challenges and prospective research works for improving the overall energy output of MA-MFC. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - An ever increasing demand for animal protein products has posed serious challenges for managing the increasing quantities of livestock manure. The choice of treatment technologies is still a complicated task and considerable debates over this issue still continue. To build a clearer picture of manure treatment framework, this study was conducted to review the most frequently employed manure management technologies from their state of the art, challenges, sustainability, environmental regulations and incentives, and improvement strategies perspectives. The results showed that most treatment technologies have focused on the solid fraction of manure while the liquid fraction still remains a potential environmental threat. Compared to other waste to energy solutions, anaerobic digestion is the most mature technology to upgrade manure's organic matter into renewable energy, however the problems associated with high investment costs, operating parameters, manure collection, and digestate management have hindered its developments in rural areas in developing countries. Bio-oil production through hydrothermal liquification is also a promising solution, as it can directly convert the wet manure into biofuel. However, lipid-poor nature of manure, operational difficulties, and the need for downstream process to remove nitrogenous compounds from the final product necessitate further research. Livestock manure management (both solid and liquid fractions) under biorefinery approach seems an inevitable solution for future sustainable development to meet circular bioeconomy requirements. Much research is still required to establish a systematic framework based on regional requirements to develop an integrated manure nutrient recycling and manure management planning with minimum environmental risks and maximum profit. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass has attracted great interest in recent years for energy production due to its renewability and carbon–neutral nature. There are various ways to convert lignocellulose to gaseous, liquid and solid fuels via thermochemical, chemical or biological approaches. Typical biomass derived fuels include syngas, bio-gas, bio-oil, bioethanol and biochar, all of which could be used as fuels for furnace, engine, turbine or fuel cells. Direct biomass fuel cells mediated by various electron carriers provide a new direction of lignocellulose conversion. Various metal and non-metal based carriers have been screened for mediating the electron transfer from biomass to oxygen thus generating electricity. The power density of direct biomass fuel cells can be over 100 mW cm−2, which shows promise for practical applications. Lignocellulose and its isolated components, primarily cellulose and lignin, have also been paid considerable attention as sustainable carbonaceous materials for preparation of electrodes for supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries. In this paper, we have provided a state-of-the-art review on the research progress of lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock and materials for power generation and energy storage focusing on the chemistry aspects of the processes. It was recommended that process integration should be performed to reduce the cost for thermochemical and biological conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels, while efforts should be made to increase efficiency and improve the properties for biomass fuelled fuel cells and biomass derived electrodes for energy storage. © 2020 Science Press

AB  - Although wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as important collection points and environmental sources for now omnipresent waste in waterways, the contribution of landfills of microplastics (MPs) to environmental pollution has been overlooked. Due to high complexity and large quantity of contaminants in WWTPs and landfills, MPs discharged from these sites may pose greater risks to human and animal health through adsorbed small molecules or microbial biofilms. This review provides a comprehensive summary of current knowledge about the composition and life cycle of MPs in both WWTPs and landfills. We also discuss technologies that could be implemented in WWTPs or landfill leachate treatment facilities to capture MPs and potentially upcycle the polymers to value-added products. Likewise, we examine the challenges of implementing the different technologies given current practices and infrastructure. Finally, we highlight the areas where additional investigation is needed to devise comprehensive strategies for ameliorating the ubiquitous issue of plastic wastes in waterways: (1) the fragmentation process of plastic debris in landfills and occurrence of MPs in leachate; (2) the relationship among complex chemicals, biofilms and MPs, and their effects on wastewater treatment facilities’ performance; (3) the development of hybrid processes that leverage current wastewater treatment infrastructure for effective degrading or upcycling MPs and/or nanoplastics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Population growth, rapid urbanization, industrialization and economic development have led to the magnified municipal solid waste generation at an alarming rate on a global scale. Municipal solid waste seems to be an economically viable and attractive resource to produce green fuels through different waste-to-energy conversion routes. This paper reviews the different waste-to-energy technologies as well as thermochemical and biological conversion technologies for the valorization of municipal solid waste and diversion for recycling. The key waste-to-energy technologies discussed in this review include conventional thermal incineration and the modern hydrothermal incineration. The thermochemical treatments (e.g. pyrolysis, liquefaction and gasification) and biological treatments (e.g. anaerobic digestion and composting) are also elaborated for the transformation of solid wastes to biofuel products. The current status of municipal solid waste management for effective disposal and diversion along with the opportunities and challenges has been comprehensively reviewed. The merits and technical challenges of the waste-to-energy technologies are systematically discussed to promote the diversion of solid wastes from landfill disposal to biorefineries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.
